Some torrent sites was hacked and I immediately  checked the site leechbits.org leaked userdb

And found this :
UserID Username  Email                         IP              Passhash                          Passkey

The complete db is also released look for 14.T_orrent.Sites.H_acked.Here.Is.The.USERDBS-GOPURGE this info is from the leechbits db
