THE INCREDIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT SCENE SOAP OPERA:

"The king of theives"

Starring MFH, the artist most likely (but not confirmedly) formerly known
as DJT.

Howdy, fellow NFO-readers, nukers, groupleaders, sops and people involved.
What in the fucking hell is going wrong these days in this here mp3 scene?
Here's what went down a few days ago in the world's most illegal soap opera.

--+--
ACT 1: Something's up. Way up
--+--

It all starts off calm on a cold day in February. On  0221,  shit hits the
fan. By fan, I mean site, and by shit, I mean

Ryan_Leslie_Ft_Snoop_Dogg_-_Just_Right-CDS-2005-MFH

Mere minutes after this release is out, group OMC complains about the songs
being stolen from them, namely from

Ryan_Lelie_Ft_Snoop_Dogg-Just_Right-Promo-Vinyl-2005-OMC (dirfixed later).


So I proceeded to check this claim. Looking at the tracklists:

01_a1_ryan_leslie_feat_snoop_dogg-just_right_(main)-omc.mp3      9090096b
02_a2_ryan_leslie-just_right_(album_version)-omc.mp3             7874148b
03_a3_ryan_leslie-just_right_(inst)-omc.mp3                      7566625b
04_b1_ryan_leslie-the_way_that_you_move_girl_(main)-omc.mp3      6461794b
05_b2_ryan_leslie-the_way_that_you_move_girl_(inst)-omc.mp3      6237595b
06_b3_ryan_leslie-the_way_that_you_move_girl_(acapella)-omc.mp3  6787897b

vs

01_ryan_leslie_ft_snoop_dogg_-_just_right_main-mfh.mp3           9090040b
02_ryan_leslie_ft_snoop_dogg_-_just_right_album_version-mfh.mp3  7874099b
03_ryan_leslie_ft_snoop_dogg_-_just_right_inst-mfh.mp3           7566585b

Hoo boy, that's pretty close if you ask me. I pick one file per release and
strip out ID3 tags.

STRIPPED 03_a3_ryan_leslie-just_right_(inst)-omc.mp3             7566405b
STRIPPED 03_ryan_leslie_ft_snoop_dogg_-_just_right_inst-mfh.mp3  7566405b

Well, who would have thought, a perfect match. Even though it's not really
needed, I compare peak lines in ACID. Attached: "what_a_retag_no_way.jpg"

Well, of course that should be enough, but bear with me. I use lametag 
to extract information from these files (this will be important later).
The result:

U:\03_a3_ryan_leslie-just_right_(inst)-omc.mp3
Tag revision:       0
Version string:     3.97a
Quality:            97 (V0 and q3)
Music length:       7.566.405 bytes
Music CRC:          BFA7

U:\03_ryan_leslie_ft_snoop_dogg_-_just_right_inst-mfh.mp3
Tag revision:       0
Version string:     3.97a
Quality:            97 (V0 and q3)
Music length:       7.566.405 bytes
Music CRC:          BFA7

Now what a curious version of Lame! Those files are identical, bit for bit.

--+--
INTERLUDE: Nuking to and fro
--+--

What follows now is a rather complicated process. I believe OMC that the
file was stolen and, on my site, nuke the MFH release. Later that night
I find out that OMC pre'd another stolen release that very day (CDS of
Samy Deluxe, stolen from DAW nearly a month ago) and distrust ensues. At
the very same time, I get a hint that the leader of MFH has provided a
coverscan as proof for his claims. A member from OMC confirms that there
was, indeed, a stolen release. All this culminates in the MFH release
getting unnuked and the OMC folders being nuked for group request, stolen.

--+--
ACT 2: Fishy schemes and what the fuck
--+--

Suspicious shit happens. The day after (that's 0222), I get a message from
someone at OMC. They want to prove that their rip is legit and proceed to
do so with a metric fuckton of pictures. In less than 20 minutes, I get the
vinyl releases in question photographed from about 20 angles, with someone
holding up "RIPPED BY OMC" post-its and even measuring the record with a
ruler to prove it's a 12-inch. The blame is on MFH again, because the evi-
dence OMC provides is waterproof. Plus, they have six tracks with the same
quality level and the same codec. What in the glorious fuck is going on?

I was then contacted by a good friend who had a talk with the supposed
leader of MFH. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you to the highlight
reel of their conversation. I'll keep this NFO free of nicks, though; the
person who sent this log will be referred to as "Neutral". Whereever parts
of the conversation are missing because they would not contribute to the
information, I put (...) markers. Here goes the best-of!

--------------------------

[17:09] <MFH_Leader>  we got proves
[17:10] <MFH_Leader> about omc shit
(...)
[17:12] <MFH_Leader> dude
[17:12] <MFH_Leader> we got the real cd
(...)
[17:14] <Neutral> we are not talking about identical as in "oh they sound quite the same"
[17:14] <MFH_Leader> the dont use same encoding
[17:14] <Neutral> we're talking about identical as in "the hash-values MATCH"
[17:14] <Neutral> and oh boy do they ever!
[17:15] <MFH_Leader> i know that crc and md5
(...)
[17:16] <MFH_Leader> if you rip vinyl to cds
[17:16] <MFH_Leader> and you rip cds
[17:16] <MFH_Leader> you get the same crc
[17:16] <MFH_Leader> as vinyl to mp3
[17:16] <MFH_Leader> do you agree
[17:16] <Neutral> that is entirely untrue, and let me explain to you why that is so.
[17:17] <MFH_Leader> dude
[17:17] <MFH_Leader> vinyl is analog true
[17:17] <Neutral> first of all, a cds is made from a glass master, not a vinyl.
[17:17] <MFH_Leader> dude
[17:17] <MFH_Leader> your wrong here
(...)
[17:17] <MFH_Leader> vinyl is first source
[17:18] <MFH_Leader> and its encoded to cds until a label records i
[17:18] <Neutral> so you're telling me instead of putting a mix on a cd with 
                  means every common household has readily available today, 
                  producers FIRST produce a vinyl track which is THEN processed 
                  into a cd?
[17:19] <Neutral> and you don't see the logic flaw in this?
[17:19] <MFH_Leader> dude
[17:19] <Neutral> but whatever your logic is in this process, there is not a single 
                  possibililty that an analogue source and a digital file ripped from 
                  two different mediums by two different groups
[17:19] <MFH_Leader> its store cd
[17:19] <Neutral> have the SAME encoder in a 20 minute timeframe
[17:19] <Neutral> and a completely outlandish lame version at that!
[17:20] <MFH_Leader> i dont know how the hell they made it
[17:20] <Neutral> it is not
[17:20] <MFH_Leader> i just rip it 
(...)
[17:22] <MFH_Leader> DUDE
[17:22] <MFH_Leader> WHEM U RIP CD
[17:22] <MFH_Leader> WITH THE SAME ENCODER
[17:22] <MFH_Leader> U GET SAME CRC
[17:22] <MFH_Leader> WTF U WANT
(...)
[17:27] <MFH_Leader> i just say mine isnt stolen
[17:27] <MFH_Leader> its real
[17:27] <MFH_Leader> from store
[17:27] <Neutral> good grief please don't make a fool of yourself
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> we  both have it real
[17:28] <Neutral> dont you understand that the files are identical
[17:28] <Neutral> there is thwarting evidence against you!
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> nobody sould get nuked
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> MAN
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> I TOLD U
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> THAT
[17:28] <Neutral> what do you mean, "nobody should get nuked"
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> I 
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> F
[17:28] <Neutral> the files are _identical_
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> U RIP
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> SAME CDS
[17:28] <Neutral> don't start that again
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> SAME ENC
[17:28] <Neutral> yes, it can happen that if you rip the same CD
[17:28] <MFH_Leader> U GET THAT SAME CRC
[17:29] <Neutral> with the same encoder
[17:29] <Neutral> but NOT
[17:29] <Neutral> if you rip a vinyl
[17:29] <Neutral> (which the pics clearly show)
[17:29] <Neutral> and a CD
[17:29] <Neutral> even using the same encoder
[17:29] <MFH_Leader> BUT MY CD IS RIPPED FROM VINYL TOO
[17:29] <Neutral> then it's not from the store
[17:29] <MFH_Leader> IT IS
(...)
[17:32] <MFH_Leader> VINYL IS FIRST SOURCE
[17:32] <Neutral> the chain is master->vinyl and master->cd
[17:32] <Neutral> not master->vinyl->cd
[17:32] <MFH_Leader> DUDE DONT SHIT ME WITH THAT THEORETICAL
(...)
[17:40] <Neutral> so your last and final statement on this issue is that your 
                  release is absolutely legit, comes from a cd and that OMC somehow 
                  produced identical files from an analogue source
[17:41] <MFH_Leader> IM TELLING U
[17:41] <MFH_Leader> THAT
[17:41] <MFH_Leader> MY CD
[17:41] <MFH_Leader> PROBABLY
[17:41] <MFH_Leader> RECORDED FROM THAT VINYL
[17:41] <MFH_Leader> THATSWHY
(...)
[17:59] <MFH_Leader> i think u should unnuke omc 
[17:59] <Neutral> why is that
[17:59] <MFH_Leader> cause nobody stolen anything
[17:59] <Neutral> is that so
[18:00] <MFH_Leader> there are just 2 versions
[18:00] <Neutral> i'll leave that up to the nukers
[18:00] <MFH_Leader> vinyl and cd

--------------------------

Hello and welcome back from this trainwreck of a conversation. As you see,
the leader of MFH stands by his point that the release I talked about at the
beginning was not stolen from OMC and that there were different sources and that
OMC should be unnuked because they have vinyl and that the world would be a better
place if only. What a blessing for the scene he is. But then again, while the
group is still young, let's have a look at the amazing release list of MFH for
shits and giggles.

For this list sets the scene for our third and final act.


--+--
ACT 3: Going down down baby
--+--

There appears to be a problem right now: I don't trust this group anymore. And why,
I got a comparison chart with some OTHER releases and I'll let the dear reader
judge for himself. Pretimes in front, the rest should be easy to figure out:

18:31 VA_-_Febrero_2005_RCA-Retail-2005-MFH                 (12F 67.8MB)
22:28 VA-Febrero_2005-RCA-Promo-READ_NFO-2005-DGN           (12F 67.8MB)

14:29 Ryan_Leslie_Ft_Snoop_Dogg_-_Just_Right-CDS-2005-MFH      (3F 23.4MB)
14:22 Ryan_Lelie_Ft_Snoop_Dogg-Just_Right-Promo-Vinyl-2005-OMC (6F 42MB)
      (first three tracks - see ACT 1)

20:19 O_Ryan_FT._J-Kwon_-_Shorty-CDS-2004-MFH                  (4F 26.5MB) 
21:28 O_Ryan-Shorty_Bw_She_Loves_the_Club-Promo-Vinyl-2004-OMC (8F 54.7MB)
      (first four tracks)

08:25 DJ_Simon_-_180_Bpm_and_A_East_Ok_and_Dream-2005-MFH         (3F 15.1MB)
09:19 Dj_Simon-180_Bpm_And_A_East_Ok_And_Dream_160-Promo-2005-DGN (3F 15.1MB)

22:04 VA-Der_Deutsche_Disco_Fox_Hit_Mix-DE-2005-MFH        (18F 89.8MB)
20:52 VA-Der_Deutsche_Disco_Fox_Hit_Mix_2005-DE-2005-VOiCE (18F 89.8MB)


I think I see a trend here, folks! Unless VOiCE, DGN and OMC suddenly decided to
start stealing releases all at the same time, this is pretty obvious. Time to call
in reinforcements! Luckily, I didn't even have to call. Someone from group VOiCE
stepped forward and provided me with coverscans of the releases that MFH took
from them. Plus, and I think this settles the issue, a screenshot of MFH caught
red-handed on a US site they affiled while moving a DGN release into their predir.
To see the theives in action, please view "mfh.caught.jpg" (made by site staff)

Also, find attached: proof.zip (Coverscans from VOiCE releases stolen by MFH) 

What and why in the everloving shit this group thought they were doing and how
exactly they were going to get through with it is beyond me. Then again, what
isn't.

Thank you for reading this through, have a good week.

Yours truly.
