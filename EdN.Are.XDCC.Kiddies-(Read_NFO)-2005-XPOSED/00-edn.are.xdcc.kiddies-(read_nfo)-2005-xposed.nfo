Bob (7:35:41 PM): EdN pre'd the thursday demos as a CDR did you give your demos to anyone?
Rob (7:36:09 PM): i've only gave them to one person who i trust
Bob (7:36:26 PM): who? did you give it to X?
Rob (7:37:22 PM): not X
Rob (7:37:25 PM): i gave it to REV

Bob (7:59:32 PM): where did you get the thursday demos from anyway?
Bob (7:59:34 PM): what quality did you rip them as?
Rob (7:59:42 PM): i got them from X's ipod

ў  the with honor and straylight run were both webripped from                          ў
ў  www.victorypresscenter.com                                                          ў
ў  they claimed in their "proof" nfo that the victory site has no mp3's on it          ў
ў  "One of the nuke reasons I saw was                                                  ў
ў  "ripped.from.the.victory.website.bring.scans.for.proof.and.stop.writing.lame.nfos." ў
ў  Now, we're not really on top of what gets on the web and not, but we did            ў
ў  check out the Victory Records website, and couldn't find any MP3's                  ў
ў  (even snippets) of anything from the Straylight Run EP. Some people suggested       ў
ў  there is a "secret site" for music insiders to download full --aps rips of          ў
ў  the newest albums that Victory Records is going to release before they hit          ў
ў  stores, but we  couldn't turn up any legitimate information on such a site."        ў

ў  well if you look at scan #1 you can clearly see, that when you're logged            ў
ў  in you can stream the full album                                                    ў

ў  when they first released the straylight run it was quickly nuked.                   ў
ў  about 3 days after they released the straylight run they pre'd a "proof" nfo        ў
ў  including a scan of the cd the scan is fake on a number of reasons                  ў
ў                                                                                      ў
ў  FIRST of all, just looking at the scan you can see that it was distorted            ў
ў  SECOND, you can see that its got white parts                                        ў
ў  (from the paper they cut it out of) around the border of the cd cover               ў
ў  THIRD, if you look at the REAL retail picture in scan number 2 you can              ў
ў  see that it looks NOTHING like the scan they obviously printed out, cut,            ў
ў  and shoved into a cd case                                                           ў

ў  on another note, someone in their xdcc channel whos name will not be revealed       ў
ў  just so happened to send theREV the with honor and straylight webrip's              ў
ў  approximately 1 and a half hours before it pre'd.. strange huh?                     ў
ў                                                                                      ў
ў  Here are some logs of theREV bugging someone who ripped the With Honor              ў
ў  and Straylight Run                                                                  ў
