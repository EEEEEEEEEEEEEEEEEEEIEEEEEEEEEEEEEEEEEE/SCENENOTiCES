        ≥  
        ≥  Many of you may not see the point on accusing Unleashed for
        ≥  stealing. You say "so what? they release big, oversized clones
        ≥  for us to autotrade!". That's because you're retarted credit
        ≥  whores, who only care for their shitty clones and other crap just
        ≥  to get some credits by racing them, or simply because you are
        ≥  doing whatever possible to get the games for free.
        ≥
        ≥  Unleashed cannot do anything. They even stole their dox releases
        ≥  from other groups and www because they just didn't have the
        ≥  knowledge to make them themself. Their trainers are made by
        ≥  publicly hired people. For all the nforce people reading this,
        ≥  just go to the well known public trainer makers channel, say that
        ≥  you're good on making trainers, but looking for some team and your
        ≥  chances of being picked up by the almighty Unleashed family of
        ≥  retards are humongous! They even tried to recruit one of our
        ≥  team members.. That's how hard it is to get into the scene, and to
        ≥  the affil sites of Unleashed. We will gladly leave those insecure
        ≥  sites which still affil Unleashed, and maybe you should too.
        ≥
        ≥  iRRM was mostly working on the two smallest scenes, gamerips and
        ≥  dox. Both of them now have very small amount of groups
        ≥  contributing, though the competition is usually hard and you have
        ≥  to really work to keep the quality going. We had fun times, but
        ≥  now it is our time to step down too. Hopefully other rips groups
        ≥  will still keep it going, and prepare to rip hddvd/blu-ray games
        ≥  as well. The gamerips scene is all about talent. We maybe couldn't
        ≥  crack the latest protections either, but atleast we had pride in
        ≥  our work. We never stole anything from other groups or www. Now it
        ≥  seems to be that everyone only cares about getting the stuff free,
        ≥  no matter what the method is. That's not what scene was about.
        ≥  Just go to P2P for that, clones dont need no more talent than the
        ≥  average P2P user has. 
        ≥
        ≥  As a last note from us, we hope that siteops take action now and
        ≥  start dropping and banning groups that steal stuff from other
        ≥  groups or www, or which publically hire people now. That's a high
        ≥  security risk, and groups who just steal from others should be
        ≥  banned.
        ≥
        ≥  We are hoping to be back one day, in a scene where stealers aren't
        ≥  tolerated again, like it used to be in the past. Where greedy
        ≥  site operators won't just affil clone groups because they pre
        ≥  some releases traders enjoy based on credits.
        ≥  The scene isn't about that. Its about friendship, competition
        ≥  and that bad feeling about losing a release because the other
        ≥  group was just a little bit faster. It's sometimes frustrating,
        ≥  but actually it's what makes the best memories. I remember one
        ≥  of our rippers working on a game, a few seconds later the game
        ≥  was released by another group. I was downloading their release
        ≥  just to find out that it was pretty messed up, and by that we
        ≥  could finish our release and proper them. ;) Sometimes we could
        ≥  easily spend a night on it, even tho we all had important stuff
        ≥  scheduled for the next day. And I remember the hours of coding
        ≥  some tools, and the frustration when they didn't work at first,
        ≥  but because of the good team we had we got them working and our
        ≥  rips were good, always. Chatting at the same time, while working
        ≥  on the rels -- that's a thing many groups lack now a days even
        ≥  tho they really should be having it, as it's the nicest thing you
        ≥  can have. What we cared about was doing something together,
        ≥  competing with our rival groups and just spending good time
        ≥  together. And that's what we still do, but not just as releasing
        ≥  stuff, because on todays scene it just isn't worth it. We would
        ≥  still like to see gamerips scene to continue, release rips and get
        ≥  back up again. Hopefully when hddvd/blu-ray games comes out
        ≥  gameripping gets up as it was before.
        ≥  Because that is where the real talent is located.
        ≥
        ≥  This is our last release, so we would like to greet the other
        ≥  groups who (most often ;)) did an awesome job:
        ≥  DIVINE, FAS, HATRED (HATEDOX), PIZZA, RITUEL, TNT and VACE
        ≥
        ≥  btw Unleashed, your unlocker for Robin Hood's Quests... It's just
        ≥  crap, how would you call it unlocker when you cant progress the
        ≥  levels at all? It's just another lame hack and you didn't care to
        ≥  reverse engineer the savegames correctly, like usual.
