There has been talk about a recent site bust, where a 200TB swedish site was hit. there was a recent scene notice about one of the siteops, so this could be something to do with the recent closed of SECU, but not confirmed.
 
 Anyone who did affil or trade on that site it is recommend to protect your ip, if you used a proxy then things should be fine, remember security keeps the scene secure.
