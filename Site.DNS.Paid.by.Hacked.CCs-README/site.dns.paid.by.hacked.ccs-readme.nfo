This is a first for me...

Site Name: DNS
Datacenter: SL
Owners: wild_thing (74.136.71.238) 
        r3devil    (74.136.71.238)
Speed: 100Mbit
IPs: 208.101.57.26
     208.101.57.27

It seems that R3DEVIL's mother has wanted to get in the same 
business as him.. Pretty weird if you ask me. 

wild_thing has been running a site and paying for the slaves
via hacked credit cards.. This is a SERIOUS security problem,
I never even thought someone would be so fucking dumb to even
attempt this..

If you are on this site get delpurged NOW! This is for your own
safety aswell as your friends, associates, colleagues. Siteops
are encouraged to delpurge these two people.

SL does not confirm credit card payments, so anyone can do this.
I hope, in time, that they do fix this problem as it is an
extreme security risk to us all; they are a great datacenter.
