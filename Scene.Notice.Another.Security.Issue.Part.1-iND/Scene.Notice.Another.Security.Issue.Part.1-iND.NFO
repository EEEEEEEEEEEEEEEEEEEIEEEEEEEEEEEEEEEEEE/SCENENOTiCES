Any timestamps are EST.

On 10-28-04 ****.us had a security breach when 2 users SmOt-PoKeR _SmOt-PoKe!x@d66-183-241-255.bchsia.telus.net/@66.183.241.255
and JDogg x@stolen.panties.are.mine-now.us/@68.185.235.20 completely sabotaged and wiped a site upon which they were siteops.

[28/05:37] <******> 15INVITE: _SmOt-PoKe!x@d66-183-241-255.bchsia.telus.net failed to invite himself as smot<- Added 
this so you can see that he was a user at one point and that the info we give about him is true.

The site in question experienced a full site wipe and almost lost the entire userdb. Luckily the site was shut down before
total damage was done. ie. full userdb loss.  

There are logs that prove they smot repeatedly added NEW users and gave them numerous logins with 0 ratio without consulting
anyone.

Also other examples show  him "giving free" credits to other people as hgh as 90GB. 

They also make other backdoor accounts with siteop as sec grp.

There are logs of JDogg and smot who created backdoor accounts,backdoors appearing to be affil users, 
and system accounts "drftp" instead of "drftpd" There was a pre user that had siteop as secondary grp and *@* ip.

They used these accounts to go into the site and deleting/purging every user as well as 
site wiping ALL the site. Anyone has these users are strongly advised to deluser and kick/ban them. 

They frequently give themselves ridiculous things like 10 leech slots with num_logins 10 10 and they add users with leech 
all the time without consulting anyone or having permission to do so.

There is also proof that they tried to cover their tracks by editing the log files on the master. ie. 24h+ chunks of log 
missing for some strage reason.

The second nfo with the logs to back all this up will follow.

We decided that we should get this first part out ASAP to try and stop the spread of damage being caused by these individuals.
