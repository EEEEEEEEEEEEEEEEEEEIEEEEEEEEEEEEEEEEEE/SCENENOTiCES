Hello guys!

You may have noticed the latest WiiD pres or probably been nuked for trading them.
Lets first define what Scrubbed and Rip mean:

Rip: Data (Game data like intros, outros, unwanted language files or system updates) have been removed ("ripped")
Scrubbed: Each Wii disk contains a filesystem that doesn't use up all the space of the disk leaving the remaining
          bytes in an undefined state, which looks like random bytes, so that the compression rate of the backup
          is rather low. The so called Wii Scrubber replaces those bytes that aren't used by files of the
          filesystem with 0xff, so that the compression rate of the backup is increased.

Now lets look at the filesystem of some wii backups:

You should be able to see that the partition containing system updates in the WiiD releases is removed.
WiiD is telling you in their nfo: "To clear this thing up: THESE ARE *NO* RIPS!"
So you now have 2 proofs that their pres are rips, if you don't believe us try it by yourself, get a so called
"rerip" of them and the full and valid release of it and compare it with a tool that is able to show you the
filesystem like Wiiscrubber or wiifuse.

If you take a look at the .iso file of WiiD with a hexeditor like WinHex you will notice that
a lot of the bytes contain the value 0x00, Wiiscrubber can generate an iso file of a complete wii dump the same
way, just having 0xff bytes instead of 0x00. If you want to patch Wiiscrubber 1.40 to replace the not used bytes
in the image with 0x00 instead of 0xff, open the WIIScrubber.exe in a hexeditor and replace the 0xff byte at the
offset 0xE3DE with 0xff (containing the data byte of assembler instruction .text:0040E3DD push 0FFh). Now you can
use Wiiscrubber to generate isos with the same result like WiiD has with their rerips. So not having random
looking bytes in the WiiD iso shows that the backup got scrubbed on the fly by the new dumper they seem to use.
Who can tell if a game cant detect that it got scrubbed?

So you got proven that WiiD is preing scrubbed rips of wii games which already have been pred weeks to years ago.
Their nfos contain just shit talk without any proof. If you want to reduce the size of your wii archive, just
scrubb the games yourself.

Siteops should think about letting a group affil that does not even know what they are releasing.
