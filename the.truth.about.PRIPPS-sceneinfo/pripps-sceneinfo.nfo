Hey there

This info will show u what PRIPPS is doing.
PRIPPS are re-encoding other groups dvdr releases to svcd-swesub.

Here is the proof

2005-04-13 Never.Die.Alone.2004.NORDIC.PAL.DVDR-BIZARRE
2005-04-16 Never.Die.Alone.2004.DVDRIP.SVCD.SWESUB-PRIPPS

2005-04-12 Wimbledon.2004.NORDiC.PAL.DVDR-NmG
2005-04-14 Wimbledon.2004.DVDRIP.SVCD.SWESUB-PRIPPS

2005-04-11 Taxi.2004.NORDiC.PAL.DVDR-FLAWLESS
2005-04-12 Taxi.2004.DVDRiP.SVCD.SWESUB-PRIPPS

2005-04-07 The.Manchurian.Candidate.2004.PROPER.MULTiSUBS.PAL.DVDR-PROFiLE
2005-04-11 The.Manchurian.Candidate.2004.DVDRIP.SVCD.SWESUB-PRIPPS

2005-03-31 Oceans.Twelve.2004.PAL.DVDR-KEBABSAX
2005-04-03 Oceans.Twelve.2004.DVDRIP.SVCD.SWESUB-PRIPPS

Why dont these guys release their SVCD-SWESUB before other grps release their
DVDR ? The truth is, THEY CANT, because they need to re-encode others releases.

This is really lame, and we´ve seen it before with DuNKeL and ViLSE...

It´s time to do something about it!

Ohh, another thing. PRIPPS, u should ALWAYS put info about bitrate and passes. 
Those are the rules! Follow them or get banned.


Over and out..
