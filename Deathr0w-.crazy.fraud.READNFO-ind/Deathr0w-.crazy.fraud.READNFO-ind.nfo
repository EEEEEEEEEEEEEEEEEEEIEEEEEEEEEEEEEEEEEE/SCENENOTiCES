Just some important information about a user named deathr0w- (currently using the nick _D_ because apparently someone stole his other one for some reason or another).

Why you should question whether you should keep him around:

He's been arrested multiple times for varying things. The most recent one is when he was arrested for something like 11 counts of insurance fraud and had one of his computers confiscated for a few weeks. He's in NZ so the scare factor for this isn't exactly high, but still thought you oughta know. Oh, the other charge he had was assault... ask him which family member he assaulted.

Most recently he had a site he siteop'd on.. well he had +1 .. not very competent though. So in an effort to get rid of another siteop deathr0w gets a diabolical plan. He goes around offering users on the site (that he was a sitoep of) accounts on other places, the only catch is that they have to stop supporting the site (he was a siteop of). Support dropped, he then went crying about how the site had no support because (the other siteop, the one he disliked) had angered everyone into leaving. .. How could this plan ever fail?! .. It's fucking amazing! .. Ohh .. well when the main boxop found out the truth to the crap deathr0w- had been doing he had no choice but to take the site down (after being up for 9 years) out of fear that deathr0w- would turn crazy narc'y if he just demoted him to normal user. .. What kind of crazy douchebag comes up with this plan and is so fucking dumb that he actually expects it to work? . .You really want to have to trust someone this nutjobby?

Ohh .. and he logs everything. Fucking weirdo.
