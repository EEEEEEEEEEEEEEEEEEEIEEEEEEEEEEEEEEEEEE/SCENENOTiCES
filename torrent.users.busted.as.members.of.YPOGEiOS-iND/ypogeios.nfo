it's been seen again that YPOGEiOS is a top uploader on the scene torrents site he has 2 nicks

1.woodhead (YPOGEiOS IRC MEMBER)
2.w00dhead (YPOGEiOS IRC MEMBER)
3.cUJo     (YPOGEiOS torrent member on sct)
4.Korzonek (YPOGEiOS torrent member on sct)
5.jankcie  (YPOGEiOS torrent member on sct)
6.tekjunky (YPOGEiOS torrent member on sct)
7.Shiv     (YPOGEiOS torrent member on sct)
8.nahuj    (YPOGEiOS torrent member on sct)


irc ip for mr woodhead is 212.143.149.239

this is on linknet hiding in certain channels and auto trading from sites to the scene torrents ftp where the script auto makes
the torrent file.  he can't hide the fact that he has been caught out so if any sites affil this group i suggest you let them go
because you don't want to be part of YPOGEiOS
