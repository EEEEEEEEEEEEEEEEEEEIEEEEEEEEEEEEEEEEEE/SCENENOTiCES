Why the fuck are CU releases still appearing?

a) CU steals from web groups.

   Check the proof provided in:
    - Two.Pilots.Squirrel.v1.0.1.Incl.Keygen.READ.NFO.PROOFS.AGAINST.RIPPERS.CU-CFF
    - cu_steals_from_web.png
    - Globalscape.CuteFTP.Pro.v8.1.0.11.12.2007.7.NON.STOLEN-FUCK.CU
    - PassMark.BurnInTest.Pro.v.5.3.1026.NON.STOLEN-FUCK.CU

   In fact, they even find it quite amusing that they get caught [and admit it].
   See their self propers:
    - DVDFab.Platinum.v4.0.3.0.WinAll.Incl.Patch.PROPER.READ.NFO-CU
    - Flash.Video.Recorder.v1.00.WinAll.Incl.Patch.PROPER.READ.NFO-CU
    - GetRight.Pro.v6.3c.WinAll.Regged.PROPER.READ.NFO-CU
    - WebsitePacker.v1.1.1.166.WinAll.Incl.Patch.PROPER.READ.NFO-CU

   "Other rls was nuked because of stolen.... stolen exe...lol.
    Now here is a proper with cracked exe"
 
   Well, its not that amusing CU. You're retarded.

b) CU steals from torrents.

   Check the proof provided in:
    - cu_steals_from_torrents.png

   Well, stealing from web groups is stupid, but from p2p? That's homosexual.

c) CU doesn't know what they're doing.

   Probably about 75% of their releases they tagged 'Incl.Patch' just write
   registration keys (all stolen) to the registry. Well, thats not much of
   patch, is it boys?

d) They don't understand rules/can't dupecheck.

   Speaks for itself:

    - 2007-12-06 AntiCrash.v3.6.1.CRACKED-CU dupe.UnderPl.2002-12-19_bad.pack_missing.diz
    - 2007-12-19 NetScream.v1.12.10.2007.Incl.Patch-CU mu.CU.2007-12-07 <- 'lol'
    - 2007-12-24 Reaper.v2.020.WinAll.Incl.Patch-CU mu.ENGiNE.2007-12-15
    - 2007-12-27 VSO.Software.PhotoDVD.v2.6.2.0.WinAll.Regged-CU mu.CU.2007-12-26 <- 'lol'

e) Check:

    - Fengtao.Software.DVDFab.Platinum.v4.0.3.0.NON.STOLEN.READ.NFO-CFF
    - LmhSoft.Atomic.Time.Synchronizer.v3.9.8.191.NON.STOLEN.READ.NFO-CFF 
    - NTCore.Phoenix.Protector.v1.2.0.1.PROPER.READ.NFO-CFF

Can i suggest (as has been before), any sites affil'ing this group to immediately purge them.
They need to return back to their torrent sites ASAP. They're clearly missing them. Do not
affil this group. Traders: don't trade this group. You're only aiding a shitty thieving
group if you trade their releases. If you find yourself on a site which affils this group,
i suggest you leave. Well that, or aid a site thats sympathetic to thieves/p2p users. Which
would make you look a bit lame.

I truely hope this group disappears. Its completely lame a group exposed for this long
continues to be active. If you want the scene to have any integrity left at all (as put by CFF)
then do something about it. 

Sort it out!

And finally, you always have to end with a quote right?
