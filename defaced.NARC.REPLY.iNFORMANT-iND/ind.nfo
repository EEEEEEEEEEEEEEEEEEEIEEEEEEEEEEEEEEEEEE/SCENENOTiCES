To start off with, i am "iNFORMANT" in the above "notice".
I would like to point out that all that drama started when the poster "VICTiM" (which i will not say his nickname -- or should i say nicknames since he uses a new one every day) wanted onto a ring, that i am part of -- and of course defaced is part of...
It was decided by most of the siteops (8 or so) that "VICTiM" is to not be added for several reasons.

I was shown the whole log from "VICTiM" which he made available online (not available at this time) and i can see himself said that "scene notices" are a little kids stupidity -- and himself has told me that he will fuck defaced up... where i replied that i did not want any more drama and he should just drop it..

The samples shown in the above "notice" were all very stripped down and had no meaning.. i challange the poster to include the whole log marking out the names of certain rings and other users that are not his own nickname and defaced's... or i might do it myself.

Btw about the 3x1gbit thing, it was a joke i made up to see what he'd say and then what did he do?? he asked defaced if he can have an account there instead.

as i said.. post the whole log please and not what shows bad stuff about anybody but you

My honest opinion is you should have just accepted it when defaced told you u're not being readded to the site in question.

Btw, defaced on efnet is not even the same person :)

-iNDFORMANT (haha)
P.S. I told you no scene notices and you go ahead and fuck it all over.
P.P.S. Fellow sceners, we must do something about all these "notices", maybe for starters by stopping trading them. Thank you.


To Poster of original notice: You are the mother of 50% of "notices" of all times, please stop -- it's getting boring and i knew u'd probably try and make a scene notice out of this -- which is why i "iNFORMANT" told you not to..
