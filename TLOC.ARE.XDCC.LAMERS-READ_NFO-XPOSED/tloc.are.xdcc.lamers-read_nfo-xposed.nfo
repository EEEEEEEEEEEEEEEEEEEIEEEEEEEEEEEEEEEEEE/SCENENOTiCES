  Now, hold on a second, did i just see that? An XDCC chan announcing it 
  was available on a bot before tLOC has pre'd?? YES, we know dupedb's arent
  the most exact things, but read on...

  So, tLOC pre's there release, many people read the nfo, blah blah blah,
  So here's a paste of the NFO details (Also included in this pack)

  Notice the 'aP'? 
 
  if you read above, you'll notice aP is the abbreviation for #absolutePunk.

  Now, so far, tLOC only looks shitty for greeting a public XDCC channel. Ok.
  whatever floats your boat guys... it wont win you any friends tho..

  Now it gets interesting, a little birdy named 'bob' told me some wonderful
  info this evening. Read on...

  Yup he admitted it, tLOC is run by 'sobby' op @ #absolutepunk on wondernet
  currently serving all the nice releases the rest of us work hard for.

  Now im sure you can guess the next bit..

  1 SiTEOPS , my suggestion is to purge tLOC from your site(s), do you really
     want these lamers racing from your proud site to their sleazy little xdcc
     dump?

  2 I think a sceneban is in order here, sleazy little XDCC kiddies serving
     the stuff you worked hard to get your hands on. XDCC makes the scene
     insecure, which is NOT what we need right now, remember a few weeks ago?
