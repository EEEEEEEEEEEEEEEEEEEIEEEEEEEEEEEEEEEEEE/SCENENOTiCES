Hi , this nfo concerns person who pred today release with list of IP's 
torrent uploaders.I dont know from where that kind of idiots come from.
Think u fuck face before u do another worthless nfo.
First of all that list will change NOTHING , 70% of ppl on that list with IP 
are noobs that dont know what scene is , 30% know what scene is but they are not
so dumb as author who wrote nfo about them , they dont upload from IPs that they have on scene u moron.
So u can suck my and their cocks,because u will never find or ban us. Another thing is that u took
screenshots on realese that was not an scene realese  lool , it's another reason that shows u are a fucking noob.
One thing in this whole case is very intresting , account of person who did this nfo ( screenshots with that account and
IPs that were connecting to this account are in this realese so look at it ) have over 1 TB of data uploaded on p2p and
almost 150 GB of downloaded data , he had account 76 weeks on that torrent page. 

2005-08-12 - Demoted to 'Extreme User' by bhd.
2005-01-02 - Promoted to 'Uploader' by beline.

This is from his account history , he was uploader for 8 months and that kind of person is talking about banning 
p2p uploaders? LOL , i am laughing all day long.U thought u are smart  didn't u ? that we will never know from wich
account screenshots was made? idiot.. and now the best part : person who did nfo before, was vento from DvF , on screenshots there is a list of IPs that have been logging on Pizzaman account.


PS. u called your grp Scene Rescue Team = SRT ,but u wrote SCT that is equal too SceneTorrents LOL , maybe u download from SCT too much :P
