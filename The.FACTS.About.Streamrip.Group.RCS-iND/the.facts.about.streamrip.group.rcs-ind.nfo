Where to start with the group RCS (Radio Cyber Station).....?????

I think it is better to start with why stream ripping is wrong and against
scene rules. There are many different net radio stations broadcasting
sets from big name artists, and groups like RCS are ripping the web
stream, re-encoding from 128kbps/160kbps to 192kbps, tagging with a fake
source (SBD/LINE) and claiming not to stream rip. This NFO will prove
that they are.

I have taken screenshots from Encspot from 4 RCS releases. They are from
different artists and radio stations:

airbase_-_nordic_moments_004_guestmix_(party107)-sbd-08-16-2006-rcs.jpg
c_jay_-_locked_up_progressive_sounds_(etn.fm)-sbd-08-17-2006-rcs.jpg
chris_allen_-_boom_029_(party107)-sbd-08-15-2006-rcs.jpg
marcel_woods_-_electra_008_(etn.fm)-sbd-08-17-2006-rcs.jpg

If you take a look at the .jpgs included, you will notice that each set
has been encoded exactly the same, using the same version of lame
(Lame 3.95). Is this coincidence? I dont think so. The screenshots have
been taken from 4 random RCS sets that have been released recently. If
you look at any RCS release with Encspot, you will notice that they have
all been encoded the same.

Secondly we come to the skips in the mp3 files. This happens when a
webstream buffers, and is evident of a streamrip. These skips and 
glitches are in most RCS release. I have included a short sample of
such a skip;

01-pascal_bennung_-_champion_sounds_042_(party107)-sbd-08-16-2006-rcs.mp3

take a listen to the sample, it has been completely untouched from the
original release. Not only are there skips/glitches in the release,
the sound quality alone suggests that it is a re-encoded streamrip.

Last, but by no means least, is the third sample I have included in
this NFO. RCS released a set from Chris Allen that was PROPER'd by
1KING:

Chris_Allen_-_BOOM_029_(Party107)-SBD-08-15-2006-RCS [150MB] [MP3]
Chris_Allen-BOOM_029_(Party107)-PROPER-SBD-15-08-2006-1KING [161MB] [MP3]

You will noticed that the 1KING released is 11mb larger. This is because
the RCS released has 7 minutes missing from the start of the set. It
begins suddenly with Ronald van Gelderen - This Way (Rank 1 remix),
were as the 1KING release begins from the start with Phynn - Oslo
Summerparade 2006 Theme (Original mix). Take a listen to the 5 minute
samples I have included from the start of both sets;

01-chris_allen_-_boom_029_(party107)-sbd-08-15-2006-rcs.mp3
01-chris_allen-boom_029_(party107)-proper-sbd-15-08-2006-1king.mp3

both sets have been untouched from the original release.

So, if RCS are the only group that has access to legit Party107 sets,
like they claim to have;

[UNNUKE] DJ_Tim_Grube_-_TranceRun_(Party107)-SBD-08-16-2006-RCS
reason: only.rcs.have.access.to.party107

why is the Chris Allen release missing the first 7 minutes? Solid
evidence that RCS are stream ripping, re-encoding and using fake source,
which is against scene rules. You will also notice that all RCS releases
start suddenly, with no fades;

Marcel_Woods_-_Electra_008_(ETN.FM)-SBD-08-17-2006-RCS for example, more
evidence that they are stream ripping.

I also have it on good source, that at the time when the Marcel Woods
set was released, the ETN.FM ftp server was offline and had been for
atleast 24hrs, lol.

So where do we go from here? RCS is already banned on mose respectable
sites. The evidence is strong against them. A total scene ban would be
the best option.

So to finish off this informative NFO, is a list of groups with 100%
legit net radio station releases:

1KING
HSALIVE
HBLiVE
MiM
TDMLIVE
XDS

...there are also 2 other known stream rip groups;

EiTheLMP3
==========
releasing sets such as;

Matt_Darey_-_Nocturnal_050_(DI.FM)-22-07-FM-2006-EiTheLMP3

trying to convience the scene that DI.FM (http://www.di.fm) is not a
web radio station, and that they actually broadcast on FM radio.

and...


HLSMP3
=======

releasing;

Markus_Schulz_-_GDJB_Ibiza_Summer_Session__Incl_Sander_Van_Doorn_Guestmix
-SBD-08-10-2006-HLSMP3

which again is a stream rip from the DI.FM station.

It's a shame that such jokers are amoungst us in the scene, but now
they have been named and shamed we can be rid of them.

Peace out.
