On Jan 20 2007 TNT was alerted to some users in its DB. They where 
suspected of being members of a FXP Board / FXP Team. After looking
into this matter the claims where in fact true.

After purging these users, one named eth0 went on a mad hacking 
sprey. They found a security whole somehow in glftpd and broke into
a siteop account. After doing this they added *@* to thier own
account and issues a site wide nuke command on the entire site.

Once they had nuked everything they purged all sitebots on the 
server and purged their own account so userdb record could now be
pasted in this report.

The users are part of a group called DNM which is an FXP team on
www.wareznet.net This site is used to publish the info for hacked
dumps around the world. The owner of this group is Princey. He
was introduced to our group as a server owner looking to link 
with out site. After looking around his site we could not find
any evidence of activities that would put us of from using his
server. The server was linked fine for three months and Princey
even donated some $$$ to help with one of our colo server's.

After last nights attack I went onto his server and did some 
research and found symlinks from our section folders to a second
glftpd installation which had a userbase of over 400 leech slots.
I can only assume these where paid leech slots.

Here is a list of irc nicks and hosts for the users involved.

eth0 - (eth0) (eth0@cpc3-clif5-0-0-cust372.nott.cable.ntl.com)
Princey - (Princey) (princey@host81-153-14-117.range81-153.btcentralplus.com)
Sync - (Sync) (muslic69@cc626649-a.assen1.dr.home.nl)
s-h-a-k-a- (s-h-a-k-a-)/(gogo@go.blow.yourself)
[sp4wn] / [sp4wn|bnc] - ([Sp4wn|BNC])/(TanTrum@217.170.21.106)

I have the whois reports for other DNM members not directly involved with this
incident and will post them at the end of this report.

What is a real security concern is [sp4wn] was running a pre bot for our group
and he was also running pre bots in open public unsecured / unfished channels
for this DNM group and other FXP Team groups. I can only assume that he does
the same for other sure groups.

The info on this bot is, (|TNT-PRE|)/(TNT-PRE@217.170.21.106)

From what I can see / have been told his does have addpre chan access bot for
most of his bot he just echo's from other pre spam channels.

The network these teams hang out on is irc.overflow.org
I was informed today that overflow is also the name of a kiddy group on efnet
which like to root scene server's for their own fxp teams and DDoS sites who
dont allow them in. They mostly use of the shelf exploits and dont use thier
custom wrote explits which means rhunter will find them if you have had
dealings with these kiddies in the past.

They where unable to root our server's but they did try for several hours.

Here is a log from when I first saw the attack taking place.

(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) killed Quest (PID: 3288).
(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) added ip *@* to eth0.
(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) added user eth0.
(+|XXX|) [DEFAULT] + /site was nuked 10x by (hidden) - reason: fucku - nukees: (hidden)
(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) deleted (hidden).

(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) added ip *@* to eth0.
(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) added user eth0.
(+|XXX|) [DEFAULT] + /site was nuked 10x by (hidden) - reason: fucku - nukees: (hidden)

(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) added ip *@* to eth0.
(+|XXX|) [SYSOP] - (hidden) added user eth0.
(+|XXX|) [LOGIN] - (hidden) could not login, invalid password.
(+|XXX|) [DEFAULT] + /site was nuked 10x by (hidden) - reason: fucku - nukees: (hidden)

I wont paste the entire log as its pritty much the same for four server's
in total.

This group is not to be trusted and should be banned from every group they
are in. I know they have access to other topsite's as their speeds and pre
times where matching those of legit racers. I would erge every site to look
at the ip's i have listed and purge / ban every one of them to safe gaurd
your site and users.

Here is a list of other members from this and other FXP team's that i found
on irc.overflow.org - there where over 20 hacked sites hosted under one channel
all running serv-u root kits and offering content.

As you can see from these logs - this is some very disturbing info which should
not be taken lightly.

Thanks - a VERY concerned siteop
