more and more unsecure traders/siteops/users flooding our beloved scene

its up to the real-siteops to get the scene more secure by:
 - banning freaky traffic 
 - controlling the users AND traders

we have collected some ip ranges to make your life easier, just add them to
your firewall, we tested on 2.6.11 kernel with iptables 1.3.1 and it works.
unfortunately fxp transfers from blocked ranges result in 0-byte files, but
this way you can easily see who is on unsecure sources and clean your site.

got no firewall installed yet, because you are behind a router?
just start iptables.sh - this will setup a firewall and blocking
unsecure traffic. feel free to add more ranges.

If you dont know, WHAT to ban, our little "scanjet" might be something for you.
its a graphical shell-friendly frontend (using dialog (curses)) to analyze
your siteop.log

Easy check, where your current onliners transfer files to and from. 
Scanjet displays: upload/download - remote IP - remote ISP country - remote ISP
You can scan the other site for open ports, torrents ports or whatever.
Its also possible to make a traceroute. More details are described 
within scanjet. (perhaps doesnt run under all *nix systems, but should
do under suse/debian....) 

PLEASE REMEMBER! YOUR server-IP is also logged on the other sites, where
your users transfer from or to! Might be a good idea **not** to have your IP
in logs of rented servers or russian mp3 selling platforms. *wink*






p.s. if a siteop needs a techop to fix a welcome.msg, drop this site!
