[6:58:42] <SiTEOP> i called every siteop
[6:58:45] <SiTEOP> noone knew about it
[6:58:54] <SiTEOP> so we deleted all fuckin leech and changed all pw
[6:58:55] <SiTEOP> even rootpw
[6:59:03] <SiTEOP> and ofcourse we dont sell leech so thats not true
[7:00:05] <SiTEOP> u can check it if u want
[7:00:08] <SiTEOP> things got fixed now
[7:00:12] <CONCERNED_iND> could you give me a reason how it happened then?
[7:00:20] <SiTEOP> some security issues
[7:00:26] <SiTEOP> grp was added by warrior if i remember well
[7:00:30] <SiTEOP> he wasnt even on the site
[7:00:40] <SiTEOP> he was an old tech who hasnt got deleted from the shell
[7:00:45] <SiTEOP> but we fixed everything
[7:00:46] <SiTEOP> and
[7:00:54] <SiTEOP> now only ppl got shell access who is siteop on the site
[7:01:49] <CONCERNED_iND> If that is true, then I am really sorry :/

[7:02:45] <CONCERNED_iND> I didn't write the notice
[7:02:48] <CONCERNED_iND> someone else did
[7:02:56] <SiTEOP> i see
[7:03:07] <SiTEOP> but could u tell him the truth then?
[7:03:15] <CONCERNED_iND> I don't know who wrote it @_@
[7:03:20] <SiTEOP> k
[7:03:21] <SiTEOP> sorry
[7:03:28] <SiTEOP> btw i realized u arent even on the site
[7:03:30] <SiTEOP> how come that?
[7:03:44] <CONCERNED_iND> I left after I saw the notice get transferred on another site
[7:04:16] <SiTEOP> i see
[7:04:22] <SiTEOP> but u know now that thats a bullshit
[7:05:48] <CONCERNED_iND> hmmm I think I believe you
[7:06:17] <CONCERNED_iND> if you are telling the truth and everything is fixed
[7:06:23] <CONCERNED_iND> I think you should change your nickname
[7:06:26] <CONCERNED_iND> change the sitename
[7:06:28] <CONCERNED_iND> change the sitechan
[7:06:31] <CONCERNED_iND> and start over
[7:06:44] <SiTEOP> sitename is changed and sitechan too
[7:06:49] <SiTEOP> but i cant do anything with myself
[7:06:58] <SiTEOP> cause if i change nick my bnc stays the same
[7:08:16] <CONCERNED_iND> so what you say happened, was that 
[7:08:26] <CONCERNED_iND> your previous tech abused his privledges
[7:08:31] <CONCERNED_iND> and made the group?
[7:08:46] <SiTEOP> yes
[7:08:54] <SiTEOP> but he got deleted totally
[7:08:57] <SiTEOP> and passwords got changed
[7:08:58] <SiTEOP> even rootpass
