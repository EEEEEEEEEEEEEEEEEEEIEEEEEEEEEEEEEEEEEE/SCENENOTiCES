  SCENE NOTES:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Recently it has been suggested that Razor 1911 turned down an opportunity
  to become a part of a 'standards body' to define and dictate standards for
  the ISO scene at large. We would like to take a brief moment now and
  debunk this myth.

  First and foremost, the accusation that Razor 1911 somehow opted out of a
  meeting between all cracking groups is totally untrue. Razor 1911 was never
  afforded such an opportunity.

  What we were offered, through an intermediary, was a part in a plan to
  create encryption systems to make all group releases unusable by any
  individuals other than those each group deemed worthy of having the
  decryption keys and tools. This ridiculous 'offer' (if it could indeed be
  termed as such) was, of course, rejected out-of-hand.

  Aside from the fact that our releases would become totally unusable to our
  audience, which has its own set of issues, the chief problem with any kind
  of strategy of encryption and 'key management' for authorized group members
  is the problem of centralized control. Because of decentralization, one
  entity getting busted doesn't result in a domino effect where the rest of
  the scene falls apart like a house of cards. Handing the prosecution a
  potential 'golden goose' in the form of the person holding all the keys for
  his group is not only tyrannical, it is foolhardy. The only conclusion a
  sane person can make about the plan, in fact, is that the leadership that
  hatched it should be analyzed critically to determine if they belong in the
  scene at all.

  Razor 1911 is not reckless and we would prefer it if our competitors also
  chose to behave in a more prudent manner. Their actions have repeatedly
  shown us that they are unwilling to do so and that 'winning at all costs'
  is a mantra still practiced in the scene. Whether releasing marked copies
  of games, getting kicked off of sites for selling leech slots, or making
  false accusations at others, it becomes clearer every day who the real
  threat to the scene is.
