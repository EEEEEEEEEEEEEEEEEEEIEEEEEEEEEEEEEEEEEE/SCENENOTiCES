

.....BACKGROUND.....

So a new webgroup shows up, with members that nobody seems to know. Suspicions are raised
but dismissed by some in the scene as being suspicions from jealous sceners, frustrated by this new
groups willingness to pre lots of fresh Beatport material.

Those who thought it about knew that strangers simply don't wander into the scene. They must have
knowledge of it. They've either come from P2P networks, or they've been recruited by a scene group or 
perhaps split from another scene group.

Well EUPHORiC stank from the word go. A lot of Trance these days is freely available on P2P forums as
leaked 320kbps mp3s way before the scene rel comes out. EUPHORiC's obsession with 320kbps raised our
curiosity. They/He didn't seem to split from any known group. Could it be that they came from P2P?

That itself isn't a huge crime, perhaps they've abandoned their P2P sharing and embraced the scene? Or
perhaps they're still actively involved with P2P networks and forums and all things 320kbps.

Well we done some digging and we can confirm that at least 1 EUPHORiC member is stupid enough to 
still carry on uploading torrents of scene releases and take part in seeding these torrents on 
TranceTraffic and Tranceroute.



.....THE EVIDENCE.....

IRC Servers: several IRC servers where we encountered the EUPHORiC member known as Jarryd

* [jarryd] (riposte@im.jarryd): jarryd
* [jarryd] is a registered nick
* [jarryd] @#xbox360 #utorrent #trancetraffic #Pornbits #P2P-Net #oink @#MiNiMAL 
* [jarryd] area51.us.p2p-network.net :P2P-NET
* [jarryd] is using a Secure Connection
* [jarryd] End of WHOIS list.

irc.p2p-network.net:6667

-----------------


* [jarryd] (pancakes@im.jarryd.net): My real name?
* [jarryd] efnet.xs4all.nl :homosexuals are gay
* [jarryd] 85.17.216.33 :actually using host

Efnet BNC

-----------------

* [siphonate] (siphonate@ppp121-45-235-156.lns10.adl6.internode.on.net): EGADS!
* [siphonate] irc.easynews.com :your usenet, our world.
* [siphonate] 121.45.235.156 :actually using host

Efnet (taken before he pinged out, IP subsequently changed to 121.45.167.110 once he was back online)

-----------------

* [jarryd] (jarryd@ppp121-45-167-110.lns11.adl2.internode.on.net): jarryd
* [jarryd] is a registered nick
* [jarryd] #mp3shops %#BBC.Radio.1 #armind #afterhours 
* [jarryd] anjuna.il.us.mixxnet.net :Anjunabeats MIXXnet IRC Server

irc.mixxnet.net:6667

-----------------

Using his real IP address (121.45.167.110) we were able to browse his home server as he was openly
running an Apache webserver. Note, he has a Dynamic IP address.

----->	NOTE: check listing.htm this is the main index that Apache was serving.

We already knew this guy was in EUPHORiC, siteops will also recognise the IP and Nickname. We were
not looking for proof that this guy was in EUPHORiC but nonetheless found some small things
anyway. There are many references to Jarryd in listing.htm. So we know that Jarryd = Siphonate.

----->	NOTE: img001.jpg as listed in listing.htm is a hi-res scan of a release 
	28.11.2007 VA-One_Love_Mobile_Disco-3CD-2007-EUPHORiC

----->	NOTE: nforeplace dir was actually a EUPHORiC .nfo file creator with some php/java
	scripting and forms to allow the input of Artist/Title etc. Sadly because it's
	server side scripting i wasn't able to save the .php file since client users
	can't see the code. So i can't prove it existed!

Anyways, im happy that this guy belongs to EUPHORiC. Now onto the proof that he uploads and shares
scene material on torrents.

The moron actually has a screenshot on his own website.

----->	NOTE: http://images.jarryd.net/theirsoryours.PNG
-----> 	NOTE: image1.PNG (same image in case his website is closed)

Says it all really. Trancetraffic and Tranceroute websites open showing him logged in to both.

-----> 	NOTE: jarrydtt1.jpg
-----> 	NOTE: jarrydtt2.jpg

Images we've obtained ourself showing Jarryd sharing a whopping 329gb on Trancetraffic alone, with
several torrents he's uploaded himself of scene releases.

----->	NOTE: ttpriv-1.mrc.txt

An MIRC script Jarryd uses for inviting to the Trancetraffic channel. You can see it listed in
listing.htm.

Now onto Jarryds friends!

He's associated with a guy who's nickname is Silxx who i assume is a TranceTraffic Admin, so 
well in fact that he's hosting Silxx's BNC on his own server @ Leaseweb.

-----------------

* [Silxx] (pancakes@really.silxx.net): Silxx
* [Silxx] #fifa09 +#Stealth360 
* [Silxx] efnet.xs4all.nl :Proudly relaying oper-only info for five years!
* [Silxx] idle 05:20:43, signon: Mon Oct 20 16:21:36
* [silxx] End of WHOIS list.

Efnet BNC

-----------------

* [Silxx] (pancakes@trancetraffic.noobie): Silxx
* [Silxx] is a registered nick
* [Silxx] &#trancetraffic &#MiNiMAL ~#xbox360 
* [Silxx] area51.us.p2p-network.net :P2P-NET
* [Silxx] is using a Secure Connection
* [silxx] End of WHOIS list.

P2P-Net

-----------------

silxx.net resolves to 85.17.216.34, owned by Jarryd. Leaseweb offer 2 IP addresses for their 
dedicated servers and Jarryd already has his own website at 85.17.216.33.

Now a simple google search brings up many interesting links of Silxx + Trancetraffic

----->	NOTE: http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=silxx+trancetraffic&btnG=Google+Search&meta=

Including this little gem: Trance Traffic 4th Aniversary Birthday Bash July 2008 - Mixed by Silxx,
and this forum post: http://filesharingtalk.com/vb3/f-bittorrent-43/t-tt-mods-come-here-now-1-235972/ 
about a TT user complaining his account is hacked and someone else responds that Silxx is the man to
fix it!.

----->	NOTE: silxx_only.txt

also available at Jarryds website! http://www.jarryd.net/files/silxx_only.txt

Appears to be a linux log file from commmand line showing Silxx how to encode .wav files and adding 
ID3 tags to MP3s, they even used the EUPHORiC pre and .wavs they bought from Beatport as an example!.

Good stuff EUPHORiC.

----->	NOTE: silxxtt1.jpg
----->	NOTE: silxxtt2.jpg

Silxx uploading a whopping 4TB, probably nearly all scene releases.

Is Silxx with EUPHORiC also? perhaps. Strange why Jarryd is showing Silxx how to encode .wav to .mp3 
and using a EUPHORiC example. Regardless of Silxxs's activities, we've proven that Jarryd associates 
with Silxx, a known TranceTraffic admin.



.....CONCLUSION.....

Jarryd = Siphonate

He's active on TranceTraffic and Tranceroute websites. He's shared scene releases and
continues to remain active on these torrent sites.

He's associating himself with a TranceTraffic admin, Silxx, who may or may not be in EUPHORiC, but
its quite possible that he is.

His attitude to the security of himself and his group is non-existent. We obtained all this info
with simple searches, IP whois' and NO HACKING.

Do you really want these guys on your site? Or perhaps you were stupid enough to take them
already without thinking first. WEB groups with no established scene members are the biggest
risk to your site and the scene.
