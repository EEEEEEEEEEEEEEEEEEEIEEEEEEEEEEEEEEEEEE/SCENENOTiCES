
First off, I would never do such a thing, second off this bitch put out a notice about my
site months ago for fake bullshit since i would not sell him a slot.  I told him he could
attach a server to my network, and then he notice spammed my shit.

Now i believe this will show u exactly whats happening;

network 1:
[17:11:50] <xxx~[OBSCENE]> still selling leech :)

I would suggest removing this user off any of your sites, as he poses a major security risk, by asking to buy leech,
then blackmaling siteops for access.  This user should not be on any of your sites, just looking out!
