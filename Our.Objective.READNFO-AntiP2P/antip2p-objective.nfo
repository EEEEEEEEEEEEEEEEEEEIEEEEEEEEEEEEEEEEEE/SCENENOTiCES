Just been informed about "AntiP2P.What.Is.Your.Objective-P2PPro", VERY interesting read, it will be pasted here between -- because their shitty sites dont have many autotraders, just leechers :/

Stop this fucking nonsens, now!

Nobody could have missed the latest events on the scene. Where a bunch of narrow minded, 
jolt-cola drinking  nobodys claim to have full copywright of pirate material. So, I wonder, 
makes you think that you are any better than the average p2p-user? Just because you leech from 
ftp, and others from DirectConnect. Let me give you gentlemen some facts.

1. No more than 4 or maximum 5 percent of all "scene-people" contribute to the scene with real
releases. In that i mean crack applications, dvd movies and games. (NOT custom-releases as 
you made so clear) 

2. That means that over 95% of all you "scene 1337" only contribute with bandwith (sites) or 
spreading releases (traders).

Guess what. That is exactly what the p2p folks are doing as well! Do you honestly think that
just because you use the file transfer protocol, and chats through irc, you are in some way better
than the p2p dudes?

Anyone with a 10/10 internet connection could set up a "site" and call themselves a site-owner.
Then let 20 friend race new releases to this piece of crap server and start picking on
harmless p2p-users. P2p, that infact made them interested in the scene before they even knew what
ftp was.

My point is: Do not be so fuckig judgemental about the direct connect system. If you make this 
your war, do not forget to blacklist all the traders out there, whos only job is to race your 
releases. And the most tragic fact, call themselves sceneers. 

Conclusion:

Face it, you will never stop P2p. It's to big already, and its only growing stronger. Siteowners,
racers; do not forget where you came from. Do now stab your early-days friends in the back, 
trying to make your new friends like you.

The only one that gets out of this conflics alive and stronger, is the ABP.

Literally everyone who has read this has bursted out laughing.. the best guess on this is that it's sour grapes, someone involved with the hub we exposed today and trying to justify themselvies... the problem is, you little shits don't know who you're messing with. The scene does not need people who came from p2p, and definitly does not support it -- we will gladly watch you fuckers get busted and laugh... and guess what, we CAN stop p2p, the notices we provided the last few days have closed down a number of hubs and sites involved with them therefor increasing security.

Now, this "notice" that supports p2p and trying to discredit us, and many respected sceners, either came from one of the swesub groups or people involved with that hub. We urge you to trace where it circulated from and drop the user who started it, and if it's a siteop -- you have successfully found the hub's site, congrats.

Greetz to fuckers who shoot themselvies in the foot, thank you for leaving a bread crum trail waiting to be found. People who saw where this circulated from, please discuss this in public so that the word spreads around so we can find out and see what we can do about it, clearly whoever it was is involved in p2p big time.
