   those other cool groups. Make Unleashed bigger than RELOADED! Because those
   cool sfclones and dupes will do it! Live the life of your heroes, be someone
   everyone could be! Now coming with a first class math book, so you could
   finally do that _cracktro_ for your _clone_ group!

   And now to the point.. :)

   As you might have noticed, we are back with an another nfo about these
   Unleashed lamers. Theres also info about some other groups in the end of
   this nfo.

   For more info, please see our previous nfo first, A Note To Unleashed, if
   you missed it.

   
   Anyways heres some info about people in Unleashed. Okay first, guy who 
   started it. Supplier of another group got frustrated and thought that why
   not start a own group. Then he went for it. There was one minor problem
   though, he didn't know how to crack, and as he left his old group, he
   didn't have crackers. But whatever, he thought, clones are enough. As he
   also was familiar with some dox stuff (more about this later), he wanted
   Unleashed to be a doxing group too. He already had dox connections anyways,
   as he ran (and is still running and supplying) #DOX at EFNet. What is that
   channel you ask? Its channel where everybody, including p2p people, can get
   their latest dox. No invite, no keys, nothing. And its easy to guess the
   channel name too. Cool, so Unleashed is delivering our hard made dox and
   cracks to everybody. Founder has irc bouncer on 64.18.1xx.xx. One of our guys
   easily hacked his account and got list of his channels. Yup, all the site
   channels, Unleashed's group channel, everything. Obliously we weren't able
   to see blowfish encrypted messages, but we catched some nice conversations
   from logs when they weren't encrypting messages. And ofcourse, we saw all
   Unleashed affilsites, their siteops, users, Unleashed members and so on.
   Pretty secure, huh :)

   Thats what comes when you run around yelling that you're in a group. But 
   where did we get this info? Lets continue.. So, Unleashed was just starting.
   It would be a clone group and a dox group. Then he found some public irc
   channels, where many newbie trainer makers and other game hackers idle and
   usually also talk :) He followed conversations on there, recruiting people.
   Those channels occasionally also have people who jump in and say that
   they're looking for a group. Unleashed recruited them, talking about how
   cool scene is. Founder of Unleashed also posted several posts on some
   cracking forums, pretty much trying to recruit crackers for Unleashed.
   But ofcourse more experienced crackes would already be in some other group,
   or they wouldn't even want to join the scene, so it didn't really help. So
   they needed another way to get crackers. And what would be better way than
   private messaging to newbie crackers? They cant do much, but atleast they
   can get some crap out, counting releases for Unleashed. The bad thing is
   that they're all P2P, unsecure in many many ways. Think about it, owners of
   sites which affil Unleashed or some other crap groups. If completely
   new people, not sceners, can get so easily in to Unleashed and YOUR SITES,
   what makes it harder for feds? And also they LEAK releases through YOUR
   SITES to public. And even we were able to see into your site channels,
   Unleashed's group channel and so on.. Wonder what your other affils think
   about that. Yup, still want to affil Unleashed?

   In addition, many Unleashed dox releases are stolen, or in some freaking
   weird way appear in web before they are pred. It has been also proven that
   they steal their clone releases. Remember the stealing from PLEX?
   Remember all the weird PROPER releases, with proper reason as something
   that other group didn't fix image to make it more compatible. Stolen stolen
   stolen. And more compatible? Many cant even run them at all.

   
   Then lets take a look at some of Unleasheds releases

   * 2006-09-24 The.Settlers.II.10th.Anniversary.BWClone-Unleashed *NUKED*
     2006-09-15 Settlers.2.10th.Anniversary-RELOADED

     wtf again? Clone about 10 days after cracked? Even clone after cracked?
     but also you release it 9 days after? wtf? Who do you think is in need of
     your DUPE and LAME release? We hesitated to say dupe as RELOADEDS release
     is cracked and not lame and Unleasheds release is NOT cracked and LAME.

   * 2006-10-18 Battlefield.2142.EMUDVD-Unleashed *NUKED*
     2006-10-14 Battlefield_2142-Razor1911

     again many days after cracked. and why? people cant play online with
     your release either. they still have to buy the game. so why release it?
     i could understand if you release it many days before cracked one comes
     out, or if you could play online with it. but no. wtf? and what was that
     talk about taking razors profile and just editing unl there? you cant even
     make your own damn profile.

   * 2006-10-18 Sims.2.Expansion.Pets.CloneCD-Unleashed *NUKED*
     2006-10-17 Sims.2.Expansion.Pets-CLONECD
     2006-10-17 Sims.2.Expansion.Pets-RELOADED

     Thats cool Unleashed :) What was the need for that release? Even CLONECD's
     release is lame, but I mean, you surely didn't miss RELOADED's release or
     CLONECD's release? I've made the same mistake though so who I am to say.
     Sure, it was about 15 years ago when releases didn't spread so quickly and
     there wasn't pre db's to check from like now, so sometimes you could have
     duped other group in matter of minutes or even an hour. Duping a GAME a
     day after in 2006 takes some skills though :)

   gah I'm tired, checking all your releases and noticing that you're only
   preing after cracked ones. THEY ARE NOT NEEDED! Clones are not needed in
   other ways either, maybe before cracked rel because now all games dont get
   cracked. But why the hell release after cracked release? Still lets take a
   look at Unleasheds dox releases, maybe they are better in that section..

   * 2006-08-04 Flat.Out.2.CHEAT.CODES-Unleashed *NUKED*
     2006-10-12 FlatOut_2_Cheat_Codes_NON-STOLEN_WORKING-TNT

     Lets take a look at TNT's nfo. Because there must be some mistake now,
     Unleashed stealing? Wow, it cant be true! Or can it? Ofcourse it can be,
     remember, we are talking about Unleashed now :)

    "
      Observe these "so-called cheats" that they (Unleashed) listed:            
                                                                                
      X  GIVEALL = Gives all tracks                                             
      X  RAIDERS = Gives Icecreamtruck                                          
                                                                                
      Neither one works for the only Scene-Valid release of the game (ie: the   
      RELOADED cracked DVD).                                                    
                                                                                
      Perhaps they work on other regional releases?  Or more likely:            
                                                                                
      THEY ARE STOLEN FROM THE WEB.                                             
                                                                                
      Specifically from the ps2 and/or xbox cheat codes that were publicly      
      available long before the PC release of the game.                         
                                                                                
      I mean, why else would "Unleashed" release a bunch of codes               
      ***that are not even present in any of the game files***  ???             
                                                                                
      Care to tell the scene about which *file* you found those 2 codes above   
      in, Unleashed?  Um, um, um, no reply of course....                        
                                                                                
      Anyway, those 2 Codes that they listed have absolutely no effect          
      whatsoever.  And it is not surprising since they do not exist inside any  
      of the game files.  And also "Gives all tracks???", hello!, they are all  
      fully available when you first make any profile.  The tracks don't need   
      to be "unlocked".                                                         
                                                                                
      Busted once again, Unleashed!                                             
                                                                                
      Oh, and we also give you the "GIVECASH" cheat code which was suspiciously 
      missing from the "Unthiefed", oops sorry "Unleashed", release.  That code 
      is like 5-bytes before the GIEVEPIX code in the .EXE, so how could they   
      have missed it?  (Re-read the above paragraphs)                           
                                                                            "

     Nice one Unleashed :) Maybe care to test your releases next time, and
     DO THEM PROPERLY, WITHOUT STEALING!

   * 2006-07-07 Prey.UNLOCKER-Unleashed *CRAP* *NUKED*
     2006-07-12 Prey.PROPER-RELOADED <- here is the first valid scene release
     2006-07-11 Prey-CLONECD         <- or here if you count clones
     2006-10-13 Prey_Unlocker_READ_NFO-TNT <- proper unlocker

     Unlocker before scene iso release? Wow, but not a surprise with all those
     p2p people in your group ;) Anyways its not proper unlocker either. It 
     does not unlock different starting modes. Its just a bunch of savegames
     from Unleasheds playing the game. Nothing unlocked. Read TNT's nfo for 
     more details.

   Long nfo, so heres everything short
   * Unleashed constantly recruits p2p people
   * Unleashed runs and supplies public channel #dox
   * Unleashed steals some of their clone releases and releases them again as
     propers (and invalid propers btw, if you didn't get that yet)
   * Unleashed steals some of their dox releases from web
   * Unleashed is nonsecure. We easily found out who you are and where you 
     affil. For security of some of your members and your affilsites we wont
     list them. But if you care about your security (affilsites and members),
     like you should, think again that should you have anything to do with
     Unleashed.
   * Most of Unleashed releases are nuked for being dupes, clones and lame.
   * Unleashed sucks ;)

   There was some more info about our "friends" in Unleashed :) Oh damn those
   site grpdels and site purges started flashing, oh my eyes.. ;)
   
                                                                              
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Install Notes:                                                           
                                                                            
   To burn a real 1:1 copy of this NFO with no emulation:                               
   1. Unpack release, and tool.                                             
   2. Copy tool to wherever you have this nfo and run tool.                 
   3. Look at your blank disc, and select that manufacturer in the tool's   
   dropbox. If you select the wrong manufacturer type, the game will not    
   work. It probably wont work with the right one either.                       
   4. Click patchme, and wait until it says "Patching done."                
   5. A new image will be made called unl-nfo_patched." Burn this image     
   in newest A120 at 4x speed using the datatype "SECUROM *NEW*" Also, make 
   sure the write method is set to RAW DAO. Make sure that there are no     
   checkmarks next to "Rectify subchannel data" and "Burn rmps to           
   recordable media." Also make sure that the HRE emulation and slice image
   mapping technologies are enabled, with the (still non-existing option) to
   skip the burning mode and just break your cd-r instantly, because that saves
   you some time and the result is the same.
   6. When you hit start, it will say "Image size does NOT match to         
   lead-Out recorded in TOC!                                                
   select : Keep TOC as on source CD , write until end of image file        
   (recommended). For better, maybe even working results, make sure your
   clock is against your computer in a 73 degree angle, your hard drives are
   removed and that you have turned all electricity off in your house. When
   burning is 40.8324% done, right-click your mouse. Be fast. Also remember
   to sing ketchup song as loud as you can while burning.
   7. Burn the file_id.diz as normal since it is not protected.             
   8. Install the game and play. However, you cant play this game from your 
   cd/dvd drives, or from your hard drive. You need to get industrial dvd-drive
   from company called BioZ, located in israel. It costs a bit over 6000 dollars
   but what wouldn't you do to get game for free and not support developers :)
   9. And lastly always make sure that all your hard drives are removed when
   playing this cool clone of ours.
                                                                            
   Warning 1 - If you get verification failed during load, then your copy   
   failed. ~And i wouldn't have guessed that, i always thought that it worked
   when that happened :)
   Warning 2 - Burning to the wrong media type than selected in the tool    
   guarantees failure. Though burning a cracked release to any media type, or
   mounting it, almost always guarantees success.
   Warning 3 - Burning the clone with Profile "Securom New 4/5" or with     
   "rectify subchannel data" or "burn rmps to recordable media" guarantees  
   failure. And like it wouldn't fail otherwise too :)                    

 
   

   Respect to the real sceners, who still know what it is about. Respect to
   those groups which dont run in public channels shouting that they're in a
   "scene group" called Unleashed and looking for more lamers to join. Respect
   to those who can properly crack, and even if cant, dont release crap.
   No respect for Unleashed.

   Unleashed  = Group of public p2p lamers
   GLAMOURY   = aka PLEX, total noobs with homemade isos 
   PSYFER     = Cool start with non-iso game in games iso scene, and couldn't
                even get the crack right :) And what was that Company of Heroes
                internal? It maybe works for your internal xvid group, but game
                scene doesn't need that.
   AGES       = Public, they even sell their shit. TNT and game scene chart,
                you shouldn't list them. They are not really part of DOX SCENE.
   DETONATiON = Just crap, and public group. aka EMPORiO/PROViSION.
