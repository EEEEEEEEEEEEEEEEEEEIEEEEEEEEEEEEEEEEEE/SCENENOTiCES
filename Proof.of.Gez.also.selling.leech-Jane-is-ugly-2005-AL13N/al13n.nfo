The basic story is:
- Jane, vampy and a few other morons run a pay4leech site.. get caught with their trousers down by a friend
- Jane thinks it me and therefor tries to say that site is mine by making a fake picture and insulting some of the finest racers i've known over the years (funny that nobodys really heard of you:P)
- The site i am an op on that she tries to turn around by saying her pay4leech site is infact this site (not true -- proof posted)
- Her proof is that Gez is selling leech (he was purged from this site a week or so after she was cuz i didnt like him any more than i liked her...

I of course got some of my friends to investigate this matter to see why the fuck she's getting her pay4leech site tech to threaten me 'anonymously' (posted down).

After a few hours someone came back with results and indeed, Gez is selling leech (however.. its not the site i am an op on that gez was purged from AGES ago along with that ugly bitch).. The reason i've taken the time to write a couple of replies on this matter is not because i got anything to cover but because i want the ring's name cleared as all the racers there know it is, and of course so that jane can get it in her thick brain that:
- i am against pay4leech
- i dont do pay4leech
- she is doing pay4leech (well.. vampy, her friend is apparently, but she's a siteop there)

And after all this, 'she' got the pay4leech site tech to pm me threatening *fucking idiot*.. he pm'd me with the 'group' the original scene notice revealing their pay4leech site was pre'd as (not by me), P4L.. on linknet.

[10:10:25] <P4L> [08:02] <P4L> guess what
[10:10:25] <P4L> [08:02] <P4L> that screen dump aint about ur site
[10:10:25] <P4L> [08:03] <P4L> its the look account on that so call pay for leech
[10:10:25] <P4L> [08:04] <P4L> and no i aint angel just a friend helping her sort this mess out

[10:13:56] <P4L> i wiull provide a screen dump later of "Gez" selling leech slots for a site called "Pepsi" on a public forum for u to admire, if they get pre'd or not is entirely up to you

^^ here is the screen dump.. and this site is not even the site they are accusing of me being on ^^ ... btw nice fake you made of the ring im on with the alien_II shit... dates going back 24 hours when u've been gone for 3 months+... lol... morons

The site in question that i am an op on used to be called PePSi (which gez, angel, vampy and some others that got purged used to be on too).. but it's been with another shorter name for the last few months -- so it would be quite confusing if gez named his pay4leech site pepsi and angel's stupidity would be justified.. but there is still the matter of them running a pay4leech site which so far has been proven true with them trying to put the shit away from them and blaming it on me and some site they got purged on?? huh.. ?

Btw, mr P4L.. u cant hide who u were, you are the site tech of this pay4leech ring i've been told:

P4L -> ~ma@62.55.157.16 : DesT-Work (destorted)

You have been uncovered, now just stop selling leech and stop trying to attack me and say im doing stuff wrong when im not..

All i can ask for the fellow sceners is to purge these motherfuckers -- and all i can ask from the motherfuckers themselvies is to stop making false accusations.. u been caught with ur trousers down now deal with it... I do not want to see any more false accusations about this specific site anymore when all ur proof is that u got purged from it (basically cuz i didnt like you .. if u got a problem sue me... *lol*)

Btw.. if anything i dont want any more said on this matter because you are just digging your own grave with false information.
