So Here It Is :)

NORDiQ propered APOCALYPSE cuz of 2 bad frames but those 2 frames were actully on original DVD ( check attached pics ) and on their rls too. Pretty sweet proper, ain't it? :)

Besides NORDiQ didn't properly remove fake cells caused by copy protection. They also raped menu to make it smaller and save space for main movie, but NORDiQ still had lower bitrate than APOCALYPSE.

So NORDiQ please check ur worthless piece of shit next time u try to proper something OR even rls something ................
