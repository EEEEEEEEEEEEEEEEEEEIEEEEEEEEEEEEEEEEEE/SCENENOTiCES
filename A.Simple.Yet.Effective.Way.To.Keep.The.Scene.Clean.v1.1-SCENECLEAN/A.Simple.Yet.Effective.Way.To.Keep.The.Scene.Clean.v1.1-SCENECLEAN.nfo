 Creator Notes..:
 
 First off,
 
 Yes I stole the 'oh so beautiful' sceneclean banner. Props to the maker (you know who you are)! 
 
 Now lets get back to business...
 
 There are still too many scene warnings and notices. We should all put an end to this.
 
 The solution against colo/rented sites is simple. Simply don't support them anymore!
 Now you may ask yourself, how? Well, that's simple as well.
 
 *nix this nifty feature called 'iptables', which allows you to set traffic rules.
 
 This little release contains a list of colo/rented providers (such as Leaseweb and OVH) and once applied,
 it blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic to them.
 
 This way, so called 'lame racers' cannot trade with your beloved private site anymore from their 'insecure' sites.
 
 A simple, yet effective way!
 
 I would like to encourage all siteops/sitetechs to add these rules to their iptables. All you have to do is add the
 execute flag (chmod +x fix.sh) and you might need to convert it to unix format (dos2unix fix.sh) and run it.
 
 To add them to your existing set of iptables rules, you need to append them. You should know how to do that yourself.
 
 After applying to script, all traffic from and to these ip ranges is blocked. Now how do you find out if someone is 
 racing from a rented site? Most likely 0byte files, as the connection is dropped. Next you tell this racer either to 
 stop racing from this source or you tell him/her to fuck off!
 
 If you start getting querys about racers not being able to send from your site anymore, that explains as well. And 
 last but not least; 'I can't login anymore!11!!ONE' Damn right you fuck! Don't even dare to log in from a colo/rented
 box!
 
 Easy as pie huh?
 
 You can find some additional info in the script itself!
 
 Play it forward, improve this release if you like and re-release it.
 
 I hope this release will help the scene to stay secure a little bit more!
