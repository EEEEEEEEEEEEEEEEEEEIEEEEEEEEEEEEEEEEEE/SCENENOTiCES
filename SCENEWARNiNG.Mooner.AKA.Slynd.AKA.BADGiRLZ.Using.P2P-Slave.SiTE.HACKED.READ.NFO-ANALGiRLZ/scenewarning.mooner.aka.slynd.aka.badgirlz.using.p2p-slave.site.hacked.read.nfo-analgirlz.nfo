		Ah... how lovely.. P2Pnutts fighting each other, could it get any better =D *highfives*

		We saw one notice the other day.. "Missing.Members.Of.DCHUB.FastMovie-P2PFUCKERS"

		There was an ip (82.145.156.***) that got our attention and thats when we decided to go under cover..

		But lets start by scanning our archive of banned retards from the past...

		*MATCH* 82.145.156.130  BiGG.SECURiTY-RISK.READ.NFO-SoftTORRENTs  (2006-10-13)
		*MATCH* 82.145.156.148  BiGG.SECURiTY-RISK.READ.NFO-SoftTORRENTs  (2006-10-13)
		*MATCH* 82.145.156.176  SECURiTY.RiSK.Ban.This.Siteowner.ASAP-LaF (2006-11-29)

		Oh.. so first indications shows this fellow has been exposed not only once before, but twice...
		Still he shows up in the headlines again, and again as siteowner, how cute.. how secure.

		Hang on, this will be a long journey through the irony of insecurity of sites that you pre on as we speak.
		No this is not an exception, its ONE GUY's THIRD EXPOSURE...

		It didnt take us long to find a way in to this site and we could directly from the slave collect:

		Site config, chan-access,
		Pictures of;

		Ehm.. well you're prolly getting the picture now.
		Its a ton of crap and a ton of pics where slaveowner having partys with his fellow hubretards.

		This is stored in a scene-site wich Mooner AKA Slynd has the highest responsibility for.

		Is there any questions you affils like to give Mooner?

		[**:**] ••• Mooner is f@LinkNet-c3443466a5.tbcn.telia.com * f
		[**:**] ••• Mooner using link-net.org, LinkNet IRC Network

		[**:**] ••• Slynd is slynd@LinkNet-c3443466a5.tbcn.telia.com * slynd
		[**:**] ••• Slynd using link-net.org, LinkNet IRC Network

		This site had no encryption whatsoever,

		Is this the kind of presites you affils want to be on?
		This guy has been exposed 2 times before and still he just walks right in through his P2P contacts and starts over again. (same ip-range etc)

		Its a sad day for humanity but a sader day for the scene.

		This shows perfectly well what a nutcase you affils are, all you ask for is speed, if its there theres no further questions asked.
		(regarding security, in best case you might go so long you ask about os, cause thats really gonna help the security with leaks)

		Show us we're wrong, please do...

		"Theres nothing we can do theese lame swedish p2p'ers get back anyway"

		Ah yeah that attitude helps a lot :D then you might ask yourself why you dont stay on exposed sites since you have no problem when banned retards get back in.

		Lets focus some more on our dear siteowner, Kawarez previously known as BiGG and PAYLoad.

		Missing.Members.Of.DCHUB.FastMovie-P2PFUCKERS/FM.JPG:

		FastMovie_Music 82.145.156.155 Pass "payload" <- iRONY !!

		Ah.. maby you missed that part Slynd/BADGiRLZ when you tried defend your last remaining fragments of so called scenepeople,
		by preing Friends.To.Friends.READ.THiS-BADGiRLZ



		STILL not convinced?
		Lets move on to Kawarez hacked site, the one Mooner AKA Slynd use(d) as site in his sitering "SpiderWeb"
		Yeah you kicked it now to look good, but this was no surprise to you, you tried to protect it as long as you could
		but when your house of cards are falling apart you abandon your p2p-friend, thats not a nice thing to do...

		From what we could collect you can see Kawarez FlashFXP (With Upload/Download/FXP Stats)
		/Proof/FlashFXP
		/Proof/ contains pics of FlashFXP stats (as you can also see if you put them in your Flash install..)
		It also contains some pics of some of his trackers hes on,
		To mention some:

		InsomniacSTATS.jpg                   (Mooner's AKA Slynds site "insomniac" )
		spider raceSTATS.jpg                 (Mooner's AKA Slynd's site SpiderWeb, 165Gb FXP'd out,... so why do the siteowners need to FXP??)

		Now what BADGiRLZ... sorry, Mooner.. i mean Slynd? erh .. im confused
		You gonna deny all this info we collected in an hour,
		From a slave you runned how long? months... ??
		You had no idea right? :D



		LOL... just browsed a BADGiRLZ nfo (Futurama.Benders.Big.Score.2007.CUSTOM.SWESUB.STV.NTSC.DVDR-BADGiRLZ), and their greetings:
		"MightyGuys WhoKnow nRon TEAFORTWO SweRoX aTerFalleT SWiX"

		How ironic HAHAHAHHA
		This must be a coincidence right..

		MightyGuys just got some users exposed in a notice,
		the day after, BADGiRLZ gets their share in Missing.Members.Of.DCHUB.FastMovie-P2PFUCKERS
		Now this one about Zlynd/BADGiRLZ..
		BADGiRLZ slave AKA P2P-lover has pictures in his slave of people wearing t-shirts with "SweRoX" on it...(/proof/prespider.jpg as stated above)
		nRon we leave unsaid, TFT and all their "Halsningar till ESB, Repris, Divxsweden.net och Undertexter.se"
		What a COiNCiDENCE Kawarez was on undertexter.se ...
		SWiX is a customgroup and we leave them unsaid but i guess its a question of time.
		What a cute couple of insecure fucktards.
		*cuddles*

		We usually say Happy purgeing but.. since the badguy is op this time i guess its something like.. Happy leaving SpiderWeb/insomniac.




		You might think we just hate everyone but thats totally wrong so,

		 Thanks to everyone else keeping the scene safe.
