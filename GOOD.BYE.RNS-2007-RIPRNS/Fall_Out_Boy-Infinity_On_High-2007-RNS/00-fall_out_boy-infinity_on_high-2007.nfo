Release Notes:

This is our last release. Enjoy!

Fall Out Boy recently spoke to Billboard about their new album, Infinity On
High. The record is the follow up to their multi-platinum major label debut,
From Under The Cork Tree. Guitarist Patrick Stump explained: From song to song
there's a completely different feel, but they all make sense in context. They've
got a few common points, but overall there's a lot of different voices and
perspectives and styles. It would be dishonest for us to hold back any of these
elements. Stump described the album's first single "This Ain't A Scene, It's An
Arms Race" as "a hip-hop/R&B song, but written as a punk song.." Beyond that, he
mentions a "borderline classic rock" as well as a greater use of piano, as well
as strings and horns, though he claims that "we were really restrained about
it." Guests confirmed so far include hip hop producer Jay-Z, Panic! At The
Disco's Ryan Ross and New Found Glory's Chad Gilbert. The record is due out on
February 6th, 2007.
