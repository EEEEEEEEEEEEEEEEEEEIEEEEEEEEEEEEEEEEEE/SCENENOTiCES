On March 17th 2007, aAF decided to go off on one of their prespam floods once
again, more for the purposes of drawing attention to themselves than to release
"their" e-books, as it would at first appear that they're doing.  As implied,
this behaviour is nothing new for aAF, and also as implied, this pisses us off.
But there is a very good reason for this, and by the end of this article it
will have you feeling very pissed off too.

It has been a rumour for several years now, but known only by few, that aAF
steals P2P releases. That is, they download torrents and then pre the contents
at sites. Today's prespam finally prompted an investigation by us into this
matter and below we present our findings.

First, allow us to digress into some background about comics. Comics are
released by various P2P groups via various P2P channels on a regular basis.
The release contents are usually in RAR or ZIP formats, renamed to either CBR
or CBZ respectively, containing a collection of images (usually in JPG or PNG
format.) The reason that the archive extensions are renamed is so that
sequential image display programs such as CDisplay, which are commonly used by
people who read comics, recognize them as a sequence of comic images. These
releases are available via just about every kind of P2P channel you could care
to imagine.

Here's where aAF comes in. aAF downloads these comics via P2P, then proceeds to
 remove the comic group's tags and copys the image sequence into a PDF. After
waiting for at least 6 months, they then release this PDF as their own to the
scene.

Now begins the detailed detective work that proves indisputably these
accusations. We have extracted aAF's JPGs out of their respective PDF files so
that you may more easily examine the differences between them, or lack of
differences.

To begin, first check out the Donald Duck And Friends JPGs and comparison
graphic included with this text. The files extracted from aAF's PDF are a
slightly lower resolution in order to fit an A4 PDF page (as well as roughly
30% larger in file size) than metaldave's, but a visual comparison of the two
images leaves no doubt that they are otherwise identical . Check the top left
corner of the cover image for a wrinkle and a white dot: both comic impurities
that are unique to that comic, but present in both DCP's and aAF's images. The
original was scanned by metaldave of DCP in October 2006. aAF released it again
as their own six months later on.

For the second example, it gets better: check out the Fables JPGs. Notice that
this time they are EXACTLY the same: the image, the resolution and the file
size down to the very byte are indifferent. The only difference is that the
original is from a comic scanner named Nile from, behold, June 2002. Two
thousand and two for fucks sake! Since aAF have a monopoly in the scene of
ripping off comic books from P2P, they can go back in time as far as they like
when they're scavenging for something new to pre, since nobody will have duped
them. The other sick thing about this is that there are thousands of comics
released by P2P groups on a monthly basis, so there really is no limit to the
amount of prespam bait that aAF can fish up if they allow themselves to delve
into the past for the stuff they steal.

In case you are still somehow unconvinced, consider thirdly the black and white
scans of Usagi Yojimbo. Along the very left-hand edge of the image you will
spot a reddish noise pattern that is random scanner corruption that makes the
resulting image unique. However, the same unique scanner artefacts are present
in aAF's copy, proving once again that it is indeed a copy and not an original
scan job from aAF.

To summarise, aAF does the following:
a) Take an old comic book released via P2P channels.
b) Remove all P2P group tags. Since aAF has no idea how to edit images, this
   typically results in an incomplete comic since they just strip any images
   containing group marks right out of the comic. For example, back covers are
   often stripped out in order to achieve this basic level of plagiarism.
c) Copy the comic's images into a PDF document.
d) Release the stolen comic as their own material.

Now, we all know that scene releases are leaked to P2P. But stealing from P2P
to pre via the scene? This kind of behaviour could almost give rise to a
defence for the underinflated egos of the torrent kiddies leaking scene
releases to P2P. "You steal from us so we can steal from you!" It shouldn't
require anyone else to tell you that this kind of behaviour on the part of aAF
should warrant a scene ban.

Of course you might be more convinced to take action against aAF if you knew
what else aAF was into, such as preing various DVD groups' DVD5 releases,
ripped to XviD, without permission and without acknowledgement. Unfortunately,
a discussion of aAF's other nefarious activities is out of the scope of this
notice, but suffice it to say, if you're not in the position to scene ban aAF
yourself then you should at least seek to put as much distance between yourself
and them. aAF is nothing but bad news for you, us, and the scene as a whole.
