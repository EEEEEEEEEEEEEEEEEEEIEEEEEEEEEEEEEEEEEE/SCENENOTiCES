Hey, I ain't too happy ya'll sad bitches be disturbing my friday night drinking session, so I'll be brief.

All I can say is "pr00fz??"

How do those whoises prove that one person has anything to do with another... Yeah sure, compare the list on TLC to that binsearch crap, then you will see that there's no FLEMISH or SWEDISH on TLC... The other languages are on so many different sites, that it's ridiculous trying to pinpoint it to us. So you fail there. So what have you proved? You can run nnmap? lol am happy for you. L33t skills indeed....

Now let's talk about the ppl who wrote this notice. A ain't the one to stoop to wasteman's level, but I dont' like hyppocrytes and u're really taking the mushy pea this time.

Come on CDB, dude, ofc you know that someone is on every rented site, cause you are on every one of them yourself.. with the same nick you are on priv sites. Amiwrong? I'd love to expose also what group you in and what kind of sites they affil on... But they've done nothing wrong, it's only you that listened to someone dumbass. Hint for you: ppl write a lot of things on fences, don't mean all of it is true. 

To the other person involved. You really want same faith for your new group as, so I heard, happened to the old one? Consider this a warning shot. 

Now a general note. We (sops) don't leak shit to anywhere. Can we say that our userbase 100% don't? No. Can most decent size sites sops gurantee that? No. C'Est la vie. Deal with it.
