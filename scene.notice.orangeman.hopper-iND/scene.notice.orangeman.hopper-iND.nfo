Ok, this is a scene notice to attempt to put an end to the cockroaches that are flooding the scene with noobs with dreams of bein' on our sites without working and the tools who are trying to make a profit off our, the siteop's, hard and endless work.  I was talking to an individual who has been buying site access off a forum.  They say it is a "dvdr trading" group.  As you will see by the following log you are about to read, they are actually selling leech.  Names that will come up are:

Orangeman -> the guy BUYING the leech access
and
Hopper -> the cockroach selling the leech slots.

If you have either on your site, you have people buying access and should really end this crap before if gets worse.

as you can see, I don't need to buy access.  I am a siteop and I'm sick to hell and back of these cockroaches taking advantage of our hard work.  I am releasing this in hopes that other siteops won't get put into this situation and have to deal with the same crap I've had to.
Thank you for reading this release and I hope that it helps.
