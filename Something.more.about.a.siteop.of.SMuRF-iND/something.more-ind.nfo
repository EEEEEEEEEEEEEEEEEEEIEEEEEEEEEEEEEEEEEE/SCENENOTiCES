We have all read the nfos floating around about the site SMuRF being part of a rather big dc-network.

It has also come to most of our attention that a siteop of that particular site, was a vip member on the
dc network. Since we don't want to expose nicknames, you have to use your brain for a while, sorry for that :p
Now, we have seen that he has denied usage of that/those dc-hub(s), but it has come to our attention that
he actually used it to download albums and such, so therefor he is not as innocent as he wants himself to be,
but, he isn't doing the worst part of it either as it seems to us.
