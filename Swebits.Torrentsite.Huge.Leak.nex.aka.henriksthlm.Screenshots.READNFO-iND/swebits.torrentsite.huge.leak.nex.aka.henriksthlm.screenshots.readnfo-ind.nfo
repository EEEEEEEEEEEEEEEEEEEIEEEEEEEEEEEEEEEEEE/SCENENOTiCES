So... what do we got here. P2P-user, that have leaked over 4GB scene-pres 
in average EVERY DAY the last 597 days. IN AVERAGE! 

This is an expose you dont see everyday, luckily and sadly enough. :~

We weren't even looking for this guy, this was just a coincidence we caught 
him with his pants down. Anyhow, we thought this was so interesting that we 
might even give it a very own notice. 
You see, there is those bad guys taking places in notices, thats uploading
fast with low pretimes.. and of course, these should be removed from our 
beloved scene. These guys seems to be leaking for a short time, then getting
exposed or went home to mama or something. 
Then we got guys leaking a lot for a long time... these guys are also a huge 
security-issue. Not only are they leaking new releases, they also seed them 
for a long time. 


Ok, lets cut the crap. Here is what we got: 

We found this guy on a huge swedish torrent-site, Swebits. He were seeding
with the ip 84.55.75.93, and we scanned our sites for it. 
Oh, tada, we got a match! 

DEBUG 10 okt 2006 00:00:00 [FtpConn thread 21278 from 84.55.75.93] 
net.sf.drftpd.master.BaseFtpConnection.service  - << USER nex

So, we checked what we got on the user, and found this. 
(of course things are cencored.. one of the things cencored is his currygroup, 
who immediately took repudiation from the behavior of their 'member'.)

You can see that his IRC-nick is "xen", and when you whois him, you get the following.. 

xen is ~nex@LinkNet-3436c9888c.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se * nex
xen using irc.glassbilen.net [Glassbilen Networks IRCD]
xen is an SSL Encrypted Client
xen is actually ~nex@c-f23472d5.013-8-736b7610.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se [213.114.52.242]
xen End of /WHOIS list.


So, he is logging into ftp-sites with his p2p-seed-IP, and probably uses a bouncer 
for irc-use. 

People of The Scene! Take this information, see the sceenshots and act upon it. 
We know this guy is running sites and is opping a serveral. (only on LinkNet 
he is opping 9 chans, 3 of the looks like sitechans.. 
Remember, if you support this guy, you are indirect a supporter of P2P.. we dont want 
that, now do we? :~


The Scene IS NOT SECURE until these leaks are sorted out. Leaks and whores should never
ever be allowed to stay on The Scene. YOU are responible to act with this information. 

Hang on tight, more notices incoming. We have heard that a member of a swedish dvdr-group 
is long-time admin on a torrentsite.. stay tuned!
