It has recently come to my attention that several of our rips have been stolen from other communities that are not scene-related.  I would like to first apologize to all the members of said community, and let it be known that this member has been removed from our ranks, and is no longer affiliated with the group.  I have requested that the following releases be nuked.  If they aren't on your databases yet, please update.  Dropkick_Murphys-The_Warriors_Code-(Advance-)2005-EdN, Nine_Inch_Nails-With_Teeth-UK_Bonus_Tracks-2005-EdN, and Finch-Say_Hello_to_Sunshine-Promo-2005-EdN.  Once again, I publicly apologize for the disturbance, and hope the scene can forgive these errors.
