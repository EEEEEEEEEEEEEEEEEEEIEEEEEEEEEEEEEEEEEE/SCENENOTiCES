Site selling leech, site selling leech. 

Sigh, I wonder when the fuck people will learn. At least if 
you're going to get into the shitty business make sure you get/have 
a fucking brain. The following site which I will bring up is run 
by a few Spanish siteOPs with basiclly no English skills at all, 
reading through their site rules is an adventure on its own...

First of all you will all wonder how I can say that they sell leech, 
where is my proof? Well that, my friends is what I will show you, 
but let us start from the top....

It was one day just like all other, it was all about fast uploads 
and slow downloads. That's when a few of the site's users began 
wondering why it was so slow, upload speed was several MB/s in 
total while download speed never even exceeded 1MB/s no matter 
how many users that leeched. Hmm, better look up where the site's 
hosted....

Interesting, the site must at least be 100/100Mbit, how come 
it's so slow?

Let's see what 'site who' shows (fig1.jpg).... Hmm, that's strange 
it says 53 users are online although we only see 24, maybe there are 
some hidden users?

Let's see what 'site groups' shows (fig2.jpg).... Wow, that's 
pretty many groups (I won't list affils and such), notice there 
are 71 in 'Friends'.

But maybe these 'Friends' race? Well let's see, 'site grpwkup' gives us 
the answer (fig3.jpg), again I removed affils and such. Nope not in the 
top10, maybe they're just slacking a bit after, let's try 'site 
grpalup 100' (fig4.jpg), again I removed affils and such. Nope, they're 
not there either, so what do we have, a group that hasn't 
uploaded a single byte.

Now, if they don't upload maybe they don't leech either, let's see what 
that brings us. 'site grpwkdn' (fig5.jpg). Wow, 595 GB, and not a single 
byte uploaded, now that's interesting, no wonder the downstream speed of 
the site was so slow.

So, let's see what we have... A site with 71 hidden users that do nothing 
but leech, at the same time the siteOPs are trying to act like they not 
knowing why they've such a slow speed. That leaves us with four likely 
situations: 

1) The site was hacked (unlikely) 
2) They have really many friends (not too likely either) 
3) Dumping into a p2p network (fuck you) 
4) Selling leech (most likely). 

- If you could win money by guessing the right answer I would put all my money 
on alternative 4), what you put yours on is up to you. Note that these guys have 
done this for a very long time, they know what this is all about and they're 
not going to stop unless we do something about it.

Now, time for some info....

Well seeing how these guys don't worry about BW either I see no problem 
with sharing their IP, I mean if they can have a dedicated group leeching 
2-3 TB/month why would they care, right? So, here are the magical numbers...

BNC: 193.43.234.7


So the old pay2leech is still alive. I would urge affils and curries to stop supporting
a site which obviously sells slots to keep their site up (or maybe even for profit!). 
The security risks involved are enormous, not to mention that if more sites get away with
this sort of behaviour, the FEDS will eventually win...

Do with this info what you want, ignore it if you want to, just don't say you weren't 
warned.
