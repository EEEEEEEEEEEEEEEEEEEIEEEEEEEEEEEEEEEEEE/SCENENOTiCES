"Farewell.And.Godbye-SVENNE-REDCROSS

 After ten years on the Scene we're stepping down and leaving it forever. We
 have been exposed by the Swedish Antipiracy Bureau whom have identified all
 of our members and sites. The good thing is that we have had the possibility
 to make a settlement.

 Our activity is immediately ceased.

 We apologies to all Swedish and foreign movie producers for the damage we
 have caused.
 Those of you who are still involved in the Scene - close down. None of you
 are safe out there."

Comment;
First, you guys gave a lot to the scene, so the hat off!
However, you must have failed miserably in the area of obtaining security.
Only pre on sites with glFTPD and enforced SSL?
That´s probably the only and best way not to EVER get busted ey? [lalz]
Lets just be damn honest, 99% of the so called 1337 groups ask only for:
Speed, Size and affils.
Not a single question about security, none mentioned none forgotten.
It would have been interesting to know what you guys did to achieve security... [?]
It would be VERY interesting to know how you guys could get busted! [?]
Or would that just be too embarrassing?
Ever considering encrypting HDD's and S.T.F.U when the police comes [?]
Sure it´s fun to know your nicks and that you made a settlement.. hehe, but that won´t help anyone with anything.
