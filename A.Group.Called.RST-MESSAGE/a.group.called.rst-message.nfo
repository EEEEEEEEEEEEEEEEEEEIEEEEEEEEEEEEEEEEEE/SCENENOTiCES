Dear Scene

Thanks for giving scene groups like RST and their equivalent RSTClassik pre access. 
They pre fake bootlegs, which are mostly homemade and free from web. 
They rip a vinyl and release every track from the one and same vinyl
as an independent single vinyl, we really need more such groups. 
They do a terrific job! They really try hard to tag their rips with 
the correct year. Sometimes a year is hard to find, especially on the cover
or music databases on the web. If they can't find the correct year, 
they just tag it with 2007 which looks very good for the stats, because
stats rule. Siteops love stats, not quality, that's why they get pre access.

Sincerely
A couple of scene fans

PS1: This message contains a great portion of sarcasm
PS2: If you still don't get the sarcasm do some dupechecking and some research
PS3: If you still don't get it, we included a list with 30 of their latest 
     (at the moment of writing) "2007" releases
