Hello fellow sceners.

This notice to make you (especially siteops and owners) aware of an user fxp'ing releases to FXP boards and usenet via this IP : 84.41.198.59

Dns resolved 84.41.198.59 to h8441198059.dsl.speedlinq.nl
http://www.speedlinq.nl

They offer Cable/fiber in .NL and they are one of the fastest providers in .NL.
This could very well be the users own IP as they offer ADSL/Fiber to home owners.

The release in question (Outlaw.2007.DTS.NL.PAL.DVDR-COOLBEST) was released today at two sites only in the entire site scene, one of these is my site, and I know for a fact (from logs) that the release did not get raced from my site after the group pred it.

At the other site it was pred at it was only leeched a single time before it was found on usenet and other boards, thats why youre getting this notice now.

With these 3 facts I dont feel the need to begin a begin a bigger investigation, its all just too obvious, and not to say, TOO fucking dumb..



Do what you want with this information.

Keep it real and keep it safe.
