----------------------------------------------------------------


We'd like to respond to the allegations made by BAJ in their nfo.


1) The 2HD cap should not have been pred. It was a capper error and 
had someone been around to check it, it would never have been released
in that form. I was shocked to find someone pred it in that state.

2) We never tried to hide anything on the 821 repack. We noticed that
the capper (same one from this rip), used the wrong audio. So we grp.requested
that one and reencoded with proper audio and made note of it in the NFO.
Nothing was hidden. Unlike some other nameless grps that will repack with a note
saying "oops we made an error". We admitted to the wrong audio.

3) There is nothing wrong with the CROP on any of the episodes. Big Brother
uses many different cameras and the crops are not indentical. We base our 
crop on the camera that gives you the most visible screen information. We could
crop it more but then you will be losing a lot of picture data.

In terms of our earlier release we provided ample proof of not only a bad crop
but a clearly mislabelled source.

So to recap, yes we goofed (twice) and when we goof we own up to it. The weather
warnings are annoying as hell and had I personally been around to note them then
we wouldnt have pred or waited till we could get a clean feed from the West as we've
done in the past.

As for the knock about quality. Our BB releases have been of a consistant quality level
with the exception of the last two goofs. 

Lastly thanks for preing a rls that I can watch as I actually like this show and would be 
put off by the glitches and weather beeps too.
