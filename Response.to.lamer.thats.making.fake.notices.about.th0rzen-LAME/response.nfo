Mjallo fellow sceners..

Time to make a response on the latest nfo about me.

First of all i wanted to tell you a few things:

1. Im NOT a p2p leaker in ANY WAY and never Have been!!!
2. That vir0n site i "WAS ON" for under a WEEK.. Left it cause it was rented and had known p2p'ers.

Futhermore i had NO idea that FoV was some gay leaker..


From other nfo:
"So I spoke to a siteop I know and found out that th0rzen was the only person to race that material from a presite.
 I'm not big on coincidences."
Response:
OK LOL! I know i wasnt the only one racing.. Im on many sites with alot of the same people from
the "presite" and i saw it got raced by other people also.

From other nfo:
"Because both Xirg and th0rzen are from .dk and both on a small rented .de site with .pt
material I searched for a link between the two and came up empty handed."
Response:
How many .dk people is there on scene?

Ok.. Other nfo also said that i was the only one racing..
Well actually there was a person writing to me about that at that time that i shouldn
race it to that .pt site cause it helped siteop leaking to p2p..
Ok i stopped.. but then we figured out that it wasnt from me the files came, cause it still
got uploaded to p2p fast after pre.

So basiclly the other nfo was crap and lame..

Im not a p2p leaker, and never will be. Thank you!


Shoutouts goes to Mr_Escobar for being a retard and making a crap fake lame nfo about me :)


UPDATE ON PART TWO:

So.. Mr_Escobar still thinks im a p2p leaker.. what an idiot :)
Many people on danish scene know me irl and knows im not a p2p leaker.. that doesnt say you anything?

Ok maybe i was on one or two rented sites.. but at least theyre not selling leech? oh no wait.. they dont..
what about you site? WOOOOPS.. A danish Non_Rented site selling leech? WEHEHE.. You needed money to pay
your fucking cellphone bill? Maybe you do..
