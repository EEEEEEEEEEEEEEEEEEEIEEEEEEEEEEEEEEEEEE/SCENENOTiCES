Figured I would pass the lovely info along for the humor of it.

I know exactly who you are. You are the owner of bn.  << (sites name abbreviated.)
You do in fact steal our cams.. I havent noticed you stealing any over the last few weeks but I have seen 6 of your groups cam releases stolen from here.

I knew you were in MrNiceGuy and I knew you were in Fuze prior to you messaging me.

2-4-07 - This guy now appears to be leaking films to both mrniceguy and a new group of homos called fuze (Acctually the same homos that are in mrniceguy... I think they changed group names like undies so people cant track them down). - MelvinMeow 



Which are acctually notes I left in your profile lol.

I managed to find 1 other guy on this site which seems to be from MrNiceGuy as well. (I forget his username at the moment Ill have to see if I can track him down again.)
Since you homos started stealing our releases a bunch of other groups have started as well. I guess you guys shared your source with other groups? lol
Kinda dumb if you ask me.
Now we have MrNiceGuy, FUZE, Camera, MVS, MavenSupplier, OrcQuality, CANALSTREET, and like 5 other groups on here that are stealing our releases.

TBH Your quite lucky I havent banned you since I do know you were one of the people in at least 2 of the groups mentioned.

As far as my news page goes It is ACCURATE INFORMATION and will not be changed. 
You can contact me again if you like. I will leave your account enabled just for the embarrasment of everyone knowing who you are and what homos like you do. 



Heres some of his Personal Info in case anyone cares to contact the HOMO:
