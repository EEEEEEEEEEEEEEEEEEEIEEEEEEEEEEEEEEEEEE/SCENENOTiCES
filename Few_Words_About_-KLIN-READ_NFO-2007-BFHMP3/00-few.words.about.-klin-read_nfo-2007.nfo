Ok listen up, smth like -KLIN apears on a scene, we have to
say few words about this grp, so u can ban them or whatever u
like to do with it. KLIN is banned on a .pl scene, it is a p2p 
group, connected with -ViV and other lame groups tryin' to rls 
bad encode (e.g VA-My_Music_Fresh_Vol.8-2007-KLIN - min bitrate is
set to 160 kbps like in VA-Eska_Squad_5-2CD-2007-KLIN and rest of
their rls'es), not properly tagged music. They not only destroy 
polish scene but also shows how easy you can pre anything u want 
here on scene. So S@ and nukers plis look @ this group, ban them, and
nuke, we hope they will leave as fast as they show @ scene.
Oh one more thing, guys, try to find them affiling ur sites ;]
The are not there ? :D Yee cause they affill rented, shitty "sites"
so they are INSECURE am i right ?

Few words in behalf of B2R. We're
not accepting this shitty grp, they're banned on official PL
scene. Second thing they dont know how to rip/tag their
releases correcty. At the end they've got confirmed
connections with p2p scene/grps like ViV etc. So die!

BiL leader said:

KLIN is a pseudoscenegroup, which thinks that is on the scene. They
don't affile in PL, because in pl everybody knows about their
connections with p2p, they use some p2p dumps or rented sites/p2p
sites etc. What is more, almost all time they are breaking scene
rules, in many rlses like Fu-Krew_I_Dusza-PL-2007-KLIN they used not allowed
LAME, many dupes like Prison.Break.S01E01.PL.DVDRip.XviD-KLIN ->
dupe.BiL.2007-04-04. We can't stand it. Pls ban this grp ASAP.
