A friend of a friend told me that a person named 'connected' was asking him to help start his torrent site, called
"SceneReactor" (scenereactor.org apparently) in exchange for scene access.  I found him on my site using the same
nickname and purged him.

Here is the conversation:
<connected> kk no worries

<connected> .us

His IP is 68.145.39.41

He was on my site as 'connected' but he may also be using 'firecos'

I urge you to ban this user if you find him on your site, thank you.
