Ok kids, its not that we dont like you.
Its not that we dont like p2p, you can buttfuck your own sister as much as you all like
BUT DONT FUCKING TOUCH OUR WORK!

This is just an perfect example of why we do NOT want any leaks from the scene,
Lets see... alfonz hmmz
http://213.114.80.209 ..ops..http://213.114.80.209/pics/me/me2.jpg ... http://213.114.80.209/cv.htm i think youre starting to get the picture.

DUDE! You forgot to tell about your torrentskillz in your pretty CV i bet your chief would blow you for an account (rofl)

About "BiGG"
He was untill recently siteowner (deleted)
He will MOST LIKELY find a new place for his box, if he hasn't already joined!!!
Beware of him:
82.145.156.148 on his workstation (from wich he seeds to the tracker and host a chat-stat)
82.145.156.130 is the ip of his box!

Traders Affils OPs:
Keep your eyes open for this guy, if you got a new site recently offering ~900Gb+ you want to look closer!!!
It is also confirmed he has access to several FTP-Sites, one hosted by his friend where he also has acc to predirs!!.
We are awaiting action from ALL siteops having anyone of theese guys added.
Or else we WILL pre info about you too soon!


Guys try to get this measage FOR THE LAST TIME:

Leave one door unlocked and we will xpose everything we can on you.
There is a lot of leaks on the scene wich could have an very unpleasant surprise soon.
Leave us alone = we leave you alone.

You have been warned!
