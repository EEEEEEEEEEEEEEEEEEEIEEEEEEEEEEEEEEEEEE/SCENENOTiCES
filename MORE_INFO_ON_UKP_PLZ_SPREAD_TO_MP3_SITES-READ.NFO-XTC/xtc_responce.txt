okay....

having read the UKP reply we have a few more extra things to add that we missed out... and something else!

First off ure supposed proof looks like a notepad bullshit.. where is the screenshots? oh u dont have any ... wonder why that is? we have backed up everything we have said with EVIDENCE! ure "evidence" is notepad edited bullshit. 

UKP think they can bullshit off with a scan they got off the internet.

(stolen from p2p and the covers stolen from juno.... NIIIIIIIIICE!)

downloading a scan off juno doesnt prove anything does it.

we have also included something else from ure hub!
plz look at **title.jpg** ... they were even recuriting in there hub title! for fucks sake! unfortunately i cannot find my copy of the one that said "uk garage rippers wanted plz pm quik" but i think this is enuff.

so we can add to running the dc++ hub
stealing p2p rips re-tagging and releaseing
recuriting rippers openly in ure public hub via title
and stealing scans from juno.co.uk and pretending they are yours
posting a link to another groups ripper in an nfo with photos and real name etc (the nfo included with this pack)

is this the kinda of group you want on our affil site

this is the last thing i'm gonna say on this subject.... 

they posted one of my rippers old www.faceparty.com address in an nfo that had his photo and personal details on it.. imo that should get a group scenebanned on its own... exposing other groups rippers PHOTOS! and other personal info in an nfo is fucking bad (the profile in question had all its info removed as soon as we saw it) its hard enuff to stay safe in this scene without having rival groups giving out ure personal info. they run a direct connect hub that they download releases from and pre... they recurit openly in the hubs title! its down to all you siteops to sceneban these guys or not.... but as i've shown you these guys are seriously n00b and insecure and a theat to our scene.. imagine if they posted a link to one of your rippers/prewhore/siteop profile online? thats a bust waiting to happen. idiots like this should be kept off scene period. i still cannot believe they posted a rippers details like that in an nfo.

and as for ure apology you want UKP... what do you want one for? exposing you for the p2p whores that you are? supplying proof that u download release from direct connect then steal a photo from juno and pre something? proof that u recurit in dc++? i think you should be saying sorry to us for the MASSIVE security risk u are on our scene. 

i ask all people that have read this nfo to pass it onto all ure MP3 sites so these guys vanish for good. 

also we ask any ddos kiddies to ddos there dc++ hubs PureGarage.no-ip.com and PureHip-Hop.no-ip.com so they have no source to steal future rips from.

just say no to P2P groups! 

TEAM XTC. 

*also included is the first nfo we put out and the UKP responce to anyone who missed it.. and the nfo's they tried to pass out one of my rippers personal info on*

also note to UKH ... u still hating on XTC cos we kicked you out? its all good jay.... we know about ure links with UKP and UF. if pointing out how other groups are fucking up the scene makes us unpopular so be it.
