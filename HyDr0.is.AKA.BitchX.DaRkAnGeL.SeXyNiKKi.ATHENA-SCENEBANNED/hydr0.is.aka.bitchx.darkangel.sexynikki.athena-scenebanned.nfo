Yep,

She is back again and this time I applaud her because she went with a 'male' nick so as not to be detected as easily.  Those of us that have been here for a while know who BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA is.

Why does she have so many nicks you may ask?  Well that is how many times she has been scene banned.  Now she as back again with the name HyDr0.  She is also running the curry group BeST.

Above is the first time she was scene banned.  Go ahead and take a look in your pre chans it will be there.  

For a group like DEViANCE to back the ban she had to do something pretty serious.  What is it you ask, wellcontinue reading.

She was using stolen passwords and info from paypal accounts to purchase servers using the monthly bandwidth then letting the box drop.  Then doing it again, running a ring on these boxes and had a curry group called dieiso.  The worst part about it she would brag about it.  There may be several people reading this NFO right now that will remember when this all happened.  Hopefuly we can all see what is wrong with such a setup without having to go into detail.  This is the reason the scene ban was brought about for BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA

The rest of the things that were in the NFO are not Scene Banable offenses but lets take a look at them to demonstrate what kind of person HyDR0 AKA BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA is.

Seems she was pretending to 'date' admins for leech on thier sites and for root access.  Granted this is not a reason for a scene ban it just immoral,  You can see how this can happen in a majority male populated place.  When it got out of hand is when she did not get what she wanted from a ADMIN she was 'dating' so she would have him packeted by another ADMIN she was 'dating'.  This turned into a major packet war, those of us who remember this know what nets were involved so I will not name them. Oh ya and did I mention while this was going on she was pregnant with her fiancee's son.  Thats right she had a fianacee at the time.  As I stated pretending to 'date' lonely admins to gain axx and starting packetwars while your pregnant with your fiancee's baby, while immoral is not a reason to get scene banned.  Just gives you a look at the type of trash that we are dealing with.

What was really nice of her was since she has Admin axx from the admins she was 'dating', when they didn't give her what she wanted she would just take the ip lock off the site and paste open accounts to her member of dieiso and tell them to leech as much as they want.  I know this because I was there and I saw it.  dieiso did NOT know that the sites we were leeching off of we brought to us in this nature, we found out after the scene ban NFO came out.

She did well this time, she layed very low until she got back into her old habits of stealing sites from established rings.  She would have remained under the radar becuase I knew that people in different places were angry about slave delinking and joining OlA but I had not seen it happen so I just went about my business.  She was extra smart this time because she recruited the help of Alien_II Address: (alien@Linknet-0fb9b4b036.cytanet.com.cy) to do her dirty work.  If you see Alien_II make sure he is not actively recruiting your slaves, and if he is, don't be surprised...

So, in conclusion:

HyDr0 is BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA
HyDr0 is running the curry group BeST
HyDr0 has been scene banned several times under several different nicknames

Feel free to check out all those NFO's

Now HyDR0 AKA BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA, this parts for you listen up.  If you gonna come back again which I am sure you will this is what the 6th time you have been scene banned.  Get some new bncs

You screwed up and used bncs that we have seen you on before.  Not just one either...  Several ....

Another thing you might want to do is move out of Cleveland Ohio.  We all know that is where you live and take a look that this.  We remember when s**g*o*t went to visit you.

69.165.*.* = 69-165-*-*.clvdoh.adelphia.net

Kind of sucks you have to use your real ip on sites doesn't it?

I will not be an ass and display your true ip because I don't want to see you get packeted, although maybe people would have more scrupples then you, and would not packet you, but lets not take that chance.

ADMINS ------->  SCENE BAN HyDr0 in the name of Scene security.  Also drop the curry group BeST.

BUT DO NOT

I repeat DO NOT take it out on the members of BeST.  There are alot of good guys in that curry group that just got mixed up with a pathological liar.  I am sure that most of them are completely unaware that HyDR0 is BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA.  Also make sure that Alien_II Address: (alien@Linknet-0fb9b4b036.cytanet.com.cy) is not telling your SERVER OWNERS that he has inside information that your site is going to drop. 

CURRYS -------> Any site that does not remove someone that has been scene banned this many time I urge you to leave.  They obviously have no regard for scene security and are only interested in chasing the elusive 1 second pretime.  You as a curry can not fix this problem yourself, but you can sure as hell get out of there.  If ADMINS do not act on something like this then I shudder to think what other things are going on that they just don't care about. There are plenty of ADMINS that are serious about security and would not leave you hung out to dry

SERVER OWNERS -------> Any site that does not remove someone that has been scene banned this many time I urge you to leave.  They obviously have no regard for scene security and are only interested in chasing the elusive 1 second pretime.  You as a server owner may not be able  fix this problem yourself, but you can sure as hell get out of there.  If ADMINS do not act on something like this then I shudder to think what other things are going on that they just don't care about.  There are plenty of ADMINS that are serious about security and would not leave you hung out to dry

ANYONE IN OlA ------->  I would drop his site instantly.  This is the place HyDR0 AKA BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA is currently running.  If you choose to be associated with a site run by someone like this, hey its your ass.  Don't say you were not warned...

EVERYONE -------> We have to police the scene ourselves becuase if we do not do it no one will.  Don't let laziness or stupidity ruin everything.  Regrets of not taking action will haunt you for the rest of your days

Thats it, lets hope people make the correct decsions and remove HyDR0 AKA BitchX AKA DaRkAnGeL AKA SeXyNiKKi AKA ATHENA.  She will return and resort to her old tricks I bet anything, I give her one thing she sure is persistant.  To bad she is a manipulative, pathological liar ....

Of Course HyDr0 will deny all of this as she has done in the past numerous times...  She will blame others, make up stories and do anything she can to keep whatever sites she has.  Once a pathalogical liar, always a pathalogical liar.

Special thanks to all my sources on this.  I told everyone I would not name names of how this was all put together, and I think I was true to my word....
