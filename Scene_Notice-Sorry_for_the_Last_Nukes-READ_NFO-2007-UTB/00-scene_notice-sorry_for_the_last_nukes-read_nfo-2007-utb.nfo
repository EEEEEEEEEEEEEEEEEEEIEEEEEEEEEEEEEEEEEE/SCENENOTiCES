 €€     Well, last week we was faced with an unusual 'problem' and       €€
 €€     we decide to write a little note about these Nukes we got        €€
 €€     recently (for re-encode and fake).                               €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     We took a new supplier (the black sheep), who told us that he    €€
 €€     works in a radio station and his rips are from original          €€
 €€     sources, unfortunately he lied and fucked with us.               €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     We found the prove ourselves and banned that new supplier and    €€
 €€     everything is fine now.                                          €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     In fact this black sheep took some lossless audio from           €€
 €€     payable Usenet and used it as source.                            €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     The black sheep is kickbanned from group now                     €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     So, We are really sorry to have spread that crap,                €€
 €€     definitively it's not our way.                                   €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     We are 4 years in scene and never happened something like        €€
 €€     that with us.                                                    €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     - We Are Really Sorry!                                           €€
 €€                                                                      €€
 €€     Thanks for ppl who noticed that re-encode shit quickly.          €€
 €€                                                                      €€

 €€     Thank you for your comprehension.                                €€
