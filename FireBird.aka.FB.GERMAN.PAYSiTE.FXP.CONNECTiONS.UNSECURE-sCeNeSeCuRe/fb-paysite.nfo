yo m8's, there is a new german paysite out there, mh ok new is not right: there was a nfo some time before but it's still online.
they are hunting on time-irc and afterall-irc network for payusers under the name "rarstar" and one of the siteops called "sangria" 
on efnet and on site. he was also under the name Avenger aka Avenger_ supporting KiNeTeC (other german paysite). 
we know that sangria aka Avenger aka Avenger_ is on some private sites but we didnt found them yet. (we got ya ip ranges/provider/idents you unsecure fucker. and we know alot siteops. we gonna get you!!)
ok we dont got proofs which we can show you(showing just some logs and screens of the site and its files and so on would be bad for traders and affils),just the results of our deep research,
but when you are on the site you cannot use any download stat command like aldn or galdn or something. its all blocked. same on chan, after we got a look at it(thx to "a-affil" grp, you know we trust you :))
download stats are completly hidden and if you do !bw you dont see how many people are downloading just the bandwith, which are most of the time 1:10 (3mb up 30mb down) or even higher.
looks like if they didnt recoded the java to hide the leechers from the bandwith huh?:P yea you can hide them from stats if you want but looks like as if it was best
to this unsecure siteops to hide all dn commands .... another interesting point is the siteop "M4", maybe the name says everything to you. yes, its the guy from
fxp"scene", we checked ip's,bouncer's, etc. because we couldnt believe that someone is that stupid to use the same name in scene and fxpscene.. but in fact he is

so the decision is yours - for or against scene's security

 ip of the nl master is 217.148.165.56 port 43142 

stop destroying the scene you german bastards

have a nice day, you kn0w uS
