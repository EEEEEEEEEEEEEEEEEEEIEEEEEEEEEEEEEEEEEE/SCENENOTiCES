**************************SCENE NOTICE*************************************************

this is notice to scene about scene notice on bdi
as 420ripz was and affil on site.
and investigated the accusations about ops on site bdi being owners of xdcc channels on irc 420ripz has left the bdi site..
as sooon as they found out about the leak of thier releases to xdcc channels.

as soon as we found out about the leak we asked to be purged and un affiled from them..
and had no prior knowledge of the site being used as a fill for p2p/xdcc channels what so ever!!!!



we do not approve of this shit or condone use of our releases on any xdcc/p2p warez sites channels or whatever.
as there was other affils and racers on site and we notified them of the findings and then got purged!!!!

and thanx to all who keep the scene clean of this sort of shit


and as for any retaliation against 420ripz for being an affil on unsecure site that we didnt know
we left as soon as we found out
and actually we were the ones that made the pre und -iND about the scene leak on that site to inform all about it....

[12:02] <@XXX-XXX> PRE in 0DAY: -> 420RipZ gives us Scene.Notice.Relax.and.Chiram.onBDI.running.XDCC.channel-iND
then raced it to all other sites
didnt know it was nec. for the group to pre it but comes out prolly was better if we did 
The information was brought to 420's attention by a site/op racer who gave us information.... involving ther dealings... the person remains unamed.. but as stands accused off xdcc affil..which was only said.. too rubbish the persons nick... for findin out what he did on the site and xdcc channel now the xdcc channel is threatening him with revenge so pleez check all your sites for these people and purge immedieltly


included is some log files of xdcc channels that we took during our investigation and screen shots of xdcc channels
so you mite wanna look at the names of ops and people in these channels and check your sites and purge immediatly   well this is all the info we have at the present time but will keep you informed if we come across any more info on this site or any others

trying to keep the scene secure of xdcc/p2p and other security risks!!!!!!


BUT IN NO WAY DID WE KNOW ABOUT IT OR CONDONE IT!!!!!!!!
