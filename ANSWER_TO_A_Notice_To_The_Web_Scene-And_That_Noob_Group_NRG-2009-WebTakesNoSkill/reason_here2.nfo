Previous iNFO was not NRG , was only to notice people that they are doing wrong (if u need i can recover
a list of a lot big groups that approve the opinion). So please leave spreading shit that is prooving you
as crap guy.

First of all, thanks for answer, cause now people understand what kind of people can decide the nukes (otherwise
your answer wont't be considered).
Second, is to let u know that u are not the boss of the scene, so ''Shut the fuck up if you dont like it go away 
you wont be missed''. You probably wont miss us cause seems u hate us, but a lot people love NRG so its a pity,
but we're here for some more years to stay fucking you of course. NRG is the group that have been beating the
UK/ES dance scene for over years, so please try to check the stats before u call us n00bs.
Telling that NRG is a WEB group proofs that u dont know anything about us, cause we mostly pre vinyl/cd quality
and we only pre WEB when those vinyl/cd quality is hard to find. Point number one for us is giving the best quality
of the best tracks we like.

AND LISTEN: Common sense says not to waste your money cause it cost a lot work on getting it. So if 192k quality is
far enough for a lot people, is OK. otherwise dont u think people would proper them? that's what normal people call
common sense. Seems u're a father-child or never work cause you dont know anything about how many effort cost earn
money.

About the multiple encoders, i know not every webshop sell multiple encoders, so that's your work as nuker, and if
u want to nuke it, go buy the rls on same shop as GROUP and try to show us the shop sell at single encoders. Or just
wait other group PROPER it (from same webshop). I SAY YOU AGAIN, MULTIPLE ENCODERS PROOFS NOTHING OF P2P ON MOST TIMES
CAUSE ON WEBSHOP IS SOLD AS MULTIPLE ENCODERS. If u dont like WEB, or think is unsecure, u can go home, cause your mind is
on XIX and technologies rules the world, each time the vinyl&cd will be less used. Same as Cassette happened years ago, do
u remember? Now only few things are out on Cassette. So please, if u dont like WEB just skip it, and leave other guy from
XXI to decide that.

And wait, we're real but on not-commercial stuff doesnt exist 3 groups that can pre same rls. So there's not that point of
view. If u think that, u got an old thinking. 
Mate, i dont care about your nukes, u lose your time, most people/siteops of scene consider those nukes as lame and not a 
reason to kick us. Most people dont care what the elite scene or the nukenets says. Your work here is not needed, U LOSE
YOUR TIME NUKING ME.

Please make effort to understand the new thinking. A lot people already do.
