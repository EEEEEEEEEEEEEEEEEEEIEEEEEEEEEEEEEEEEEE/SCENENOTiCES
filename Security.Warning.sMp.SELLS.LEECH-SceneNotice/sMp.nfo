drag0n: 3x100mbit .us colo, existent up til ~2004-05-09, got wiped by a bright op to stop the slotselling ... logs below are first week of may 2004
d1vine: 3x100mbit .us colo, existed ~ middle may 2004 til end of may ... logs below are 24th / 25th may 2004, got closed cuz of slotselling, was basically drag0n with different name

additional info:


crc checker says d1vine as site name ... how convenient

sections & allowed stuff (languages for example) are identical with drag0n / d1vine

rulesset had MastersK as writeing credit ... he opped drag0n & d1vine and was the main guy behind the leechselling

box1 of sMp had the following interesting services running:
	proftpd, port 21
	glftpd (the known site), port 444
	glftpd (points at box 3, bnc-like), port 5678
	glftpd (different name ("Recycled Bytes Evolution 1", cant login with user/pass set from the known site), port 5679
	~130 open ports in 34000+ ... my guess: either one per transfer via ftp (passive port) or some public service (bittorrent tracker??)

siteop denies the existence of any other ftp servers on that box
	[22:06:00] <me> what about the other 3 ftp servers on your boxes?
	[22:06:48]« StorM|OFF » what other 3 ftp
	[22:07:32]« StorM|OFF » i dont know that sites whit port 21
	[22:07:38]« StorM|OFF » and other shits

siteop furthermore claims all ops from d1vine were kicked & changed ... TDRiSO?? (see convo with storm at the top)

day stats from some day (mid-november 2004) ... 
	<sMp1> Congrats to iND for top upping today. 46383MB uploaded !
	<sMp1> Kings of the LEECH were FSCAU with 453131MB down !
	ok ... who the fuck is FSCAU? they dont release stuff or affil shit. they dont upload shit. they did average 5.5MB/s down that day.
	oh, that week's download stats by groups, taken few hours after day change: [L] 200- [10] FSCAU 3,393 49,790MB 6
	50GB vs 450GB ... either lots of the users in FSCAU are hidden from those stats, not hidden from day stats ... or the week stats did reset, and they did 50G in those few hours.

prebot: called |slut| in all three
	its host in drag0n: |SluT|!bot@node-d-25ef.a2000.nl
	its host in sMp:    |SluT|!jeroen@84.119.256.256
	first one is dutch ... second one too, check http://www.ripe.net/whois?form_type=simple&full_query_string=&searchtext=84.119.0.0&do_search=Search
	bot was owned by BAHAMUS, op on d1vine & drag0n ... i doubt someone else would run a prebot with the same name from the same country a little later




final conclusion: sMp go to hell. including its ops. traders & affils: run like teh wind.
