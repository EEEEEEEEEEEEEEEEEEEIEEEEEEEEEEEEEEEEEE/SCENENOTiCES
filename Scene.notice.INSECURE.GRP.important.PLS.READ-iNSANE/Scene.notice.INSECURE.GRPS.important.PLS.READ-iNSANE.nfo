2nd. This info looked to be from about 2 or 3 months ago but still is up to date on most of the stuff.

Now the files
All files have been stripped some point of stuff as some is just spam that was not needed


1. insaneprechannel.txt looks to be a normal pre channel except oh whats this we have a user echoing
2. sitebots to the channel ... a big no no never echo a sitebot.

3. addpreecho.txt is just the stripped down version of the prechannel but only with the echo part.

4. insane.txt is the grps INSANE sitebot channel with all its site info's

5. insanesites.txt is just the stripped down version of the insane.txt only with the site info's
