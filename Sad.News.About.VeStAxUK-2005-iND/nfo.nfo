Hello everyone.

I'm sorry to bring you the sad news, a fellow scener known as VeStAxUK passed away this morning (GMT).
He suffered from a type 1 diabetes, and at 10:10AM GMT, he died from blood clot in the heart.
He was brought to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't start his heart again.
Sorry for spreading the news like this, but I think everyone who know's him deserves to know this.

From everyone who knows you, rest in peace Vestax.
