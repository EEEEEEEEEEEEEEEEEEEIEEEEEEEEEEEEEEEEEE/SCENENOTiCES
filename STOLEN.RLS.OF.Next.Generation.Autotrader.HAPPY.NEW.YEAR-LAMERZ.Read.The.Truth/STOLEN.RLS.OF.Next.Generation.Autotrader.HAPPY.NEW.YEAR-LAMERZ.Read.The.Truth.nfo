Next.Generation.Autotrader.HAPPY.NEW.YEAR-LAMERZ ?? What a joke!!!!

Ok 1st thing's first this is to you fuck wits that think its cool to steal an auto that took a friend/and much appreciated member of the scene years to perfect.
You have made modifications to this auto n stated that to get the parts that are missing to ICQ u WTF?????  Selling the rest????
Well!! this release at that presant time was private BUT also public to anyone that wanted to use it and it was (guess wat) FREE!

 ICQ 392738569 or eMail : atrader@web.de is the addy u asking ppl to contact u on, well guess u will only get lame ass,dumb noob ppl,like yourself to 
actually msg u on this...as rest of the decent ppl that are in the scene wont PAY or be sucked in by lame ass ppl like you.

Now to the rest of the decent hard working trader's that help support sites and get the rls's around fast... plz plz plz do not be sucked in by
this person this release is STOLEN yes STOLEN... ask about, many ppl are using the original,working copy and im sure they be more than willing to help
or share this release,rather than someone claming to have written it themselves and taking the credit for someone els's hard work.
The person that pred Next.Generation.Autotrader.HAPPY.NEW.YEAR-LAMERZ want's to make money from this nothing els,eh dont want to help
the scene or anyone innit...
Trust no-one guys!!
Only trust the ones u know.
