 looks like the nfo from 
 oct. 26th shoop-bye_bye-2007-ban was pred by some 
 inconvenient ppl with site acx. incredible how people 
 could destroy someone without proofs. 

 shoop-bye_bye-2007-ban was just a rumour from a liar
 with racing acx, it's totally fake.

 a.k.a. prst was being a dumb fuck at the time and decided to make shit up to piss me off.

 Both nfos were pred by him.
