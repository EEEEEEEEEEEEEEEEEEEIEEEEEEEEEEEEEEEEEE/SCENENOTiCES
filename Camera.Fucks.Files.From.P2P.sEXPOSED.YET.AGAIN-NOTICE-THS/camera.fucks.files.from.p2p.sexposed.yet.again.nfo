Yes it seems that time again.

We decided to stop pre'in info about these lamers for a while...
for the sake of anyone who knew/knows them...
They expose their own gay asses and when they get caught they take the people/sites they know with them.
(For refrence to this see nfos from several months back where they exposed their own pre sites BNC info.)


The following groups  Camera/CanalStreet/Rustlers once again we tell you are 1 and the same.

They rape ALL their files from p2p networks (Mostly 1 site in particular).
They even openly admit to doing so in their nfos and notices.
WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY STILL ON THE SCENE?

If you guys are worried about there being no VCD/XVID releases on the scene FUCK THAT!!!
Having releases from these assclowns around is not worth it.
You put yourselves, your friends, and your sites at risk everytime these sheepfeckers race a file.

Siteops, Racers, and sceners in general...
Do yourselves a favor... Purge these p2p stealing asswipes.

Not only are they gay with stealing releases from torrent sites.
They also pre/race from >>> 2 U.S. Colo sites. <<<
Not only are they Colo Sites....
They are freaken PAY2LEECH colo sites.

Colo sites in themselves are a security risk on the scene...
You add up the fact that they are Pay2Leech...
It makes it even more of a risk cause any Tom, Dick, & Camera 'Harry' can get on these sites.
Take to the fact that anyone with a few pesos can get on these sites... and they are bad enough as is.
You add the feckers from Camera to that list of NONO's and your a BUST WAITING TO HAPPEN.
They Fuckin use the same ips to dl from torrent sites that they use to upload/race to pre sites.
These people in Camera are so freaken gay...
They probably are also involved with P2U  (Pay2Upload) They are so low on the scene food chain right now.

Siteops running the fucking p2l/p2u sites im referring to...
do yourselves a favor...
Ban the fucks from your sites...
Dont worry about the Pesos they are sending you for axx.
Im freaken from p2p and ill send you some $$$ just to replace the funds they give. Just ban em.
The $$$ coming from me will be more fuckin secure than the $$$ your getting from Camera.
Do you really think its worth it to have these donkey-raping-clowns on your sites?


Special Note to sceners:
Yes we know they are back on our site again... they have had an account we have known about for some time.
We didnt ban 1 of their accounts 12 weeks ago like the rest of the accounts due to the fact we like having
these clowns around. It gives us all (p2p and scene) entertainment watching them get assraped by everyone.
