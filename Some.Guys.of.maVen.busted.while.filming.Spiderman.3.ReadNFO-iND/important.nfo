Hello mates,

bad news today ... some of my friends (being in the maVen-Group)
have been busted while they tried to do a piracy copy of SM3 ...
Thats very bad. There are lots of civil-police guys who are taking
care that we/you do not film the movie !!!

Be careful while doing this or just wait until a russian TC / R5 source
comes out.

Do not do the mistake my friends do ...

a guy ....
