This is a notice to all of you out there true to the scene.  This has been rumored so many times, and he has changed nicks so many times that it has to be addess and he needs to be stopped.
pd a.k.a fearsome is a parasite in the scene as we all know it right now.  We all know this is not to be about the $$ but he has made a living off of all of us.  He will continue to do this
if we allow him to.  Selling leech does nothing for the scene and this parasite makes his living doing this.  The site mlr is just one of the sites that he currently sells leech on and this needs
to stop.  If you currently race or own a server that is linked to a site that pd/fearsome is affiliated with STOP!  You are all being used and you are hurting the scene by helping this person.


The following logs are of a customer of mr. pd/fearsome.  It is all spelled out in plain english very clearly and cannot be confused or mixed up.  Just leave everything
that you are involved with concering him, and show that we all take this seriously and that this is all for the good of the scene not for the good of his wallet.  pd I hope you learn from this, and understand
that a nick change will not save you this time.  You need to stop your bad habits and none of us will help you any longer.
