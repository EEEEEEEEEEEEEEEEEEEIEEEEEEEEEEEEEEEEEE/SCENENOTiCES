We are back ... Part II

As we all could read in our previous scene notice, we made a start
with a hunting a "big" usenet leaker, we posted a ip of him so he 
might consider stop leaking scene releases. But as we all could see
on usenet, he did not stopped. So we continued our search and found
out that the leaker was part of a release group..... 

Real_life RealLife@shell2.skyberate.net * 

Real_Life thought he was anonymous on his quicknet home box (p.s ip 
might be in the next release if we still see "slaafje" posting 
scene releases on Usenet, yes it is his new nick.)

As you might all have noticed, a specific group has stopped, due to
this leaking of their member.

So all opers be aware for: Real_life and also for G_Spot, since he is
trying to gain axx back to sites under his new nick G_Spot.

G_Spot is GSpot@shell2.skyberate.net * G_Spot


Cheers !
