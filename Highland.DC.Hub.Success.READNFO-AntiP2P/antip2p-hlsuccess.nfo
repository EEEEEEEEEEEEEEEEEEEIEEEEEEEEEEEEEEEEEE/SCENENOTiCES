Just a quick line to all our friends that the Highland DC Hub closed its doors 10 minutes ago, which proves our information was correct. Some of the people whos ip ranges were given only have been found by some siteops, keep up the good work. If you suspect someone and he is in those ip ranges, it is 80% guaranteed they are your guy, and if u are in doubt... it's pretty guaranteed they are the person you're looking for.

Something interesting is that a lot of Paradise and Highland hub people were found on same sites, and of course uruk-aiy was denying he had anything to do with it (something interesting even we didn't know is that uruk was also on SMuRF). metalman is still denying he was using the paradise hub (btw, check the user list, he used it 3 days ago :P).

Another interesting fact that made our ears is that PAO pm'd someone last night trying to say he's not lame after someone made a comment about people involved in p2p are lame.

We would like to thank all the siteops which acted upon all our info in a timely manner and a few sites have even openly said they do not support these people and we would like to give our respects to these sites for dealing with a security risk and understanding what sort of trouble it could have caused them if they didn't act upon it.

A few minutes ago we saw someone spread "Even.More.P2P.Dudes-PASTAHJUL", after giving this a quick examination, it contains no proof of these people doing anything wrong (however we urge you to look into it if you know them), and ontop of this the person behind it put his nickname at the bottom (credit whore). Those are the kind of "notices" people should not pay attention to, because if you start acting without proof, everyone will start making "notices" with nicknames of people they don't like simply because they know someone is going to believe them.

We will have information on another DC hub soon, so for any of you still involved with DC hubs now may be a good time to get the fuck out.

Thank you for taking scene security seriously.

You also have to remember that the reason our notices are so successful are because of who we are, and who we know, so don't expect your "notices" of a list of people you hate to do much.

Also a nice hint for something else we're checking out is pay 4 leech sites, we have some sources about quite a few sites and people, but still putting it together. For those of you who have accepted funds and given people leech accounts in return, we know who you are and we're giving you one last chance to announce in your channel you have done this and shut down your site. We will not hesitate to leak your real names, addresses, telephone numbers and ip addresses, this is your FINAL warning. We'll be watching...

On closing we would like to say we are currently getting information about another hub and will probably release this information tonight or tomorrow...  no hints as to which hub it is.
