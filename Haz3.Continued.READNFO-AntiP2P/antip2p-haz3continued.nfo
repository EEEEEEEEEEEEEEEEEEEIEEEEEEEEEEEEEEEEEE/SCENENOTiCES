So the information about Haz3 has spreaded, where he denied all knowladge of it.. saying Kittym0n (who is actually his wife as luck would have it) is the owner of the hub and denying any part of it at all (even though his name was there until the day our rep. contacted the site we traced from the hub).

So he admits his wife runs the hub, but denies he was part of it (even though he was). He seems to be more pissed off that his wife's ip was in a notice and that someone in their hub is a snitch than he is about anything else. He also tried to say the metalman in the hub isnt the same person from the scene and that this particular metalman dont even know what an ftp is... now ask yourself, how does he know? Oh wait, his wife told him!!

Haz3 is also on several gbit sites (all swedish as luck would also have it), some interesting facts for everyone who thinks gbit .se is actually good -- Several hundred thousand people have 1gbit in sweden, all you need is to know the right people in the right area, and no shit.. true story.. someone's grandmother got upgraded from dsl to 1gbit for free and all she does is check email. Certain 100mbit ISPs in Sweden have announced that they will be upgrading to 1gbit soon, and most 10mbits are slowly being upgraded to 100mbit/10mbit.

There are some siteops that support Haz3 and even say that they know him in real life and that he doesnt do these hubs. You are completly mistaken and if you go by his word he is lying to you. He WAS involved with "his wife's hub", and even if he wasn't (which he is), his wife is the security risk.. think about it!

The warning has been given, it's your insecurity now.. siteops that are supporting him may as well be involved, get out while you can because these are exactly the people we swore to destroy, the p2pers that think they can do anything because they are "big" in the scene with their 1gbit .se sites. He is more pissed off that he has a snitch on his hub than anything else, and btw.. there are 4 snitches -- people you think are your friends, close your fucking hub and admit defeat you fucking p2per. "it's my wife's hub!! honest!!", fuck you.

Why do the rules not apply to someone simply because he's on 5 gbit sites and maybe gonna make his own gbit site soon (fuck, this guy must be living in the right part of sweden and got a lot of gbit neighbours or something)... your security is in your hands, leave the sites where siteops support this p2p idiot that thinks nobody can touch him and has some people actually believing him.

We'll be watching...
(PS. Death threats on our members aren't nice, got some nice screenshots and logs, also.. asking ircops to give you ip addresses is not allowed either, they can get into quite a lot of trouble by doing so and some people have already been alerted.)
(PPS. We are not those 10mbit idiots you think we are, and we know all about you, p2p supporters...)
