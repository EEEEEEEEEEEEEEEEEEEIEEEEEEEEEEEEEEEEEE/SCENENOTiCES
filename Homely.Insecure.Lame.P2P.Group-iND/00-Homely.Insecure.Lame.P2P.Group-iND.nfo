-= Homoly FaG Alert =- 

Dear fellow sceners. Because of the latest nfo bout our beloved fag group
Homely, I feel an urgent need to give you guys some more info bout these insecure fags

Everybody knows their leader "SpydaByte" is insecure. But the whole groups is insecure

Their nfo-maker Mark The Pig is spotted on several music forums !!
Also Homeley is present on soulseek and forums trying to find new web buyers for them

(Reminds me of QMI back in the days LOL)

Now we all know Homely has peepz from australia (hi spyda) and holland and maybe some
more fags

Fact is they steal releases from P2P groups. Homely has connections with SSK 
SSK is a P2P group wich also runs a forum (speakershock) and homely gets or steal their releases

So we can asume you can find some homoly fags on fagboard Speakershock

Also the way they present themselves in the scene is childish and inmature. 

So Site-ops, and all others who want a clean secure scene BAN those FAGS from ur sites

RIP Homely
