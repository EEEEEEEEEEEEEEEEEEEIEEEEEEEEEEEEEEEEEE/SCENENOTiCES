The last notice was a success and the site has pretty much closed down.

One of the ops of SMURF, F3AREliT3, was not in any part involved with the dc hub and was only revealed to us as being an op there about an hour before the notice pred.

When F3AR found out about the DC Hub, he was completly furious and questioned the other siteops about what the hell was going on, and 2-3 minutes later this was posted in the hubop's PRIVATE!! :) channel:
<[#OP]CyberAL> we are fucked
<[#OP]CyberAL> siten är exposed
<[#OP]CyberAL> allt åt helvete

F3AREliT3 should not be considered part of their p2p fest, and if anything he contributed to shutting that p2p source down.

It has also come to our attnetion "APB" (swesub group) has announced it doesnt care about the DC Hub and it will remain on the site.. please think about what you're saying, you are now declared a p2p group in our eyes.

F3AREliT3 is a well respected member of the REAL scene and has earned his respect many times up to now and should be treated with respect. Again, he may have been a siteop on SMuRF but he was not mentioned in the nfo simply because he was not part of the p2p crap, and we had a nice chat with him about it just before the notice pred.

As mentioned earlier, we are currently gathering more information about another big DC HUB, and btw... there is a connection between these following clues, for those of you involved with them know that we know a lot more than what we're writing here and you will have whats coming to you soon (don't doubt it, you have NO idea who is behind all this and nor do you want to know.)

Clues:
"swecheck.net", "dc hubs", "pre database", "sites" (all connected together, by a number of people).

In short, swecheck is creating a big security risk, thats as far as we will say right now, but they WILL be dealt with soon. Anybody that has anything to do with them, get as far away as you can now.

People involved in the hub are being purged from any site they are found on as we speak, stop your crap.. you dont know who you are messing with, and we know all your moves....

Greetz to the scene (the real one...)

P.S: added the sfv and rar so that its more noticeable when racing
