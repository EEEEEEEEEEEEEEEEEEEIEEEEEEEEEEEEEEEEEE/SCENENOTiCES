RE.Read.This.About.Insecure.User.Gid3oN.And.Grp.READNFO.SWEDiSH.PDTV.XviD-Kopia

Gimme more of this witch hunt plz. 

I figure my word isnt worth much but i have to do something about this. I for some reason happend to be named in a stupid scene announce without any proof blaming me for p2p business.
The reason for that was because (as the announce stated) I was friend with guy named Gid3oN. 

The truth is that ive been talking with Gid3oN in the kopia grp-channel.
I was about to join their grp and start to cap some tv for them and i did not know anything about the stuff being said in the announce.

Soo i guess its best to stay out of everthing that has something do with the swedish crap scene. (or at least crap grps like Kopia).


Most underdog ppl tend to wanna make a name(preing stuff without proof) and act like they are the big shots when they'r just guys with very tiny penises with nothing REAL to contribute.

Last but not least, im against everything that has something do with the scene leaking to p2p and insecure ppl but you shall not act without any proof imo.
If you dont have any proof, get some!


Here's a log from a conv with the guy that pre'd telling another guy that he's sorry for namning me in the nfo and that im polly innocent.
And if thats the case with him beeing sorry, this nfo should be written by him not me.

[22:37:45] <xxxxx> brukar vara så med nfoer utan bevis
