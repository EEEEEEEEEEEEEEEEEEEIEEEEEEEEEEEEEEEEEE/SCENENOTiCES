	Why glory decided to fuck with EXP and FNT if he wasn't raided?
FNT must make proofs! give us reasons if he wasn't raided! and why FNT was keeping
that info quiet when glory was raided? why SUBWAY gone down?

	SCENERS, this is right? when someone is raided the admin keeps the info quiet 
to maintain the group alive? 

	Everybody knows how this group works. They have lot of zines
arround, public sites, and they have hunters everywhere. OLDSCH00l PUNK/ROCK GROUPS CAN CONFIRM
THAT. FNT runs internal sites, owner runs a big forum and this is how FNT manipulate many groups. 
This is how FNT MANIPULATE THE FUCKING MP3 SCENE. 


	FNT, shame for SCENE and GERMANY.
