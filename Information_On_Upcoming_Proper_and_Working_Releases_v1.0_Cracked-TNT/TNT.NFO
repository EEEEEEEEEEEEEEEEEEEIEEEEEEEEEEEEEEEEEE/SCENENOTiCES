    TryMedia ActiveMark!

    What follows is a good deal of information, which I shall put into sections 
that cater to various types of people in the scene.  I will attempt to explain 
the situation as it relates to: 

    - Scene Nukers

    - End Users

    - Competing Groups



Table of Contents
=================
1. Reasoning   =  Why the WORKING releases and why this INFO release?

2. General     =  Overview of the Protection

3. History     =  The history of MS Windows and why it is important to know

4. Crashing    =  Why are the other groups' cracks crashing?

5. Releases    =  Explanation of our upcoming WORKING/proper releases

6. End Users   =  How our new releases will affect the End Users

7. Nukers      =  To nuke or not to nuke.  Ah, that is the question!

8. Competition =  Notes to our noble competitors and Hints about the protection

9. Conclusion  =  At last it ends.  Don't miss the post game wrap-up.



Reasoning
~~~~~~~~~
    Yes I know groups never make notices like this.  They think it makes them 
look lame and amateurish.  Are we the first 0day group to ever write up an 
Info Packet about tons of Proper Releases that are coming soon?  Since the 
1980's, I don't recall ever seeing a release like this one.  Enjoy.

    One note please to every other 0day group.  If you have an opinion or 
comments on what I wrote here, then I would ask you to release a reply 
statement.  You can afford to make one and not be booted off all your sites or 
laughed at.  It is ok to make an exception every now and then.  And besides, 
who is going to stop you.

    My suggestion is something like these dirnames:
    TNT_Information_v1.0_REPLY-SomeGroup
    TNT_Information_v1.0_COMMENTS-AnyGroup

    Or get in touch with us.  We welcome your opinions.

    To my knowledge, nearly every previous release of a program protected by 
ActiveMark has had a poorly made crack that was not fully functional.

    Right off the bat: 
Our WORKING releases are not OS Fixes (Operating System Fixes).  They are 
straight up CRACK FIXES.  I do this release, that you are reading now, so that 
you all know ahead of time what is going on with all of the WORKING releases 
that we will soon PRE.  Each release will refer you back to this file for a 
more thorough description of why our release is fully working, while the 
competitions' releases were not.

    The reason for the lengthiness of this file is that much of the information 
is a general assessment of the scene these days.  Even though I am writing 
about a specific protection, this information is relevant to many other 
protections and to many other broken releases (which we may proper, weeks or 
months from now).


General
~~~~~~~
    The story goes like this.  A company named TryMedia has developed a 
protection system to allow potential customers to evaluate a full version of 
a game (or any program).  A user is allowed to try the application for a 
certain amount of time (minutes, hours, or days) and/or is allowed to launch 
the application only a specific number of times.

    If the software is purchased, then you receive a license to remove the time 
or execution limits.  That seems fair of course, as you are allowed to use the 
complete version of the program to evaluate it.

    The executable code of the protection itself is able to run on almost any 
version of Microshaft Windows, such as NT - 98 - 98SE - 2000 - ME - XP - 
& Future Versions.  It may work on Win 95 and/or Win 96 (OSR2), but I have not 
tested those yet.

    From this point forward throughout the rest of the NFO file, I will be 
referring to the actual game or application, which is a separate entity from 
the protection, as the ~TARGET~.  The TARGET is the real game that you want to 
play or it is the programming code of that game which runs on your CPU.

    When a software developer has their program protected by ActiveMark, the 
protection will take the original TARGET executable file and will alter it.  
A new file is created that contains both the protection and the altered code of 
the TARGET.  The TARGET is imbedded & encrypted within the protected file.

    Now, just because the protection can run on any OS, does not mean that the 
TARGET itself will.  Some developers might program a game that only works on 
the NT line of Kernels or even only on Windows XP.

    I will veer slightly off-topic below to the history of the Windows 
Operating System.  This is relevant, in a round-about way, as to why the group 
TNT is releasing an assload of PROPER & WORKING releases.


History
~~~~~~~
    Back in the olden days of the 8086 CPU revolution, we saw the first 
releases of DOS (aka the Disk Operating System).  MicroSoft joined in with 
their own DOS, aptly named MSDOS, which btw, was partially STOLEN from other 
companies.  Well, because Gates is a filthy bitch who is power hungry and has 
no scruples.

    Soon, M$ developed their first version of Windows which was 16-bit.  This 
is what I call the Win 3.x system, which was running under DOS.  This means 
that DOS loaded first and was really in control.  Windows 3.x was running 
underneath DOS, basically as a sub-OS.  It would appear that there were earlier 
versions, but to me, Win 3.1 is where it all began.  Next, we had the networked 
versions of "Windows for Workgroups".  Later the NT Kernel was developed, which 
I remember being an acronym for Network Technology (NT).

    The whole point of the NT line of Operating Systems was Networkability.  
Which in those days was only really useful for businesses, small and large.  
The NT line of Kernels was never intended for games or home use.  It is an 
office-level, business-class software.

    Quickly I will show the progress of the Windows OS in chronological order: 

- Win 3.xx
- Win NT (NT 3 & NT 4)
- Win 95
- OSR2 (OS Release 2, which is basically Win 95 with FAT32 added.  
       and I personally call it Win 96)
- Win 98
- Win 98SE (The 'Second Edition' of Win 98.  Call it Win 99 if you like.)
- Win 2000 aka Win 2K (this was initially named Win NT 5)
- Win ME
- Win XP (which is basically Win NT 6, the sequel to Win 2000)

   The NT line of Kernels consists of:   NT - 2000 - XP
   The 9x line of Kernels consists of:   3.x - 95 - OSR2 - 98 - 98SE - ME

    As you can see, both lines were being developed simultaneously.  However, 
they are two unique branches of Kernels (the CORE of the OS).  While both are 
very similar, they do differ in some ways too.

    There was something to note right after Win 98.  M$ changed the name of NT5 
to Win 2000, which confused many people who thought that Win 2000 was the 
sequel to Windows 98 (1998).  So they "upgraded" to Win2k, without realizing 
that they had actually changed to whole new OS with a different Kernel.  The 
REAL & TRUE upgrade to Win 98 followed later, which was called Windows 
Millennium (ME).  The problem was that Win 2000 was NT-based and not a home 
user OS nor a gaming OS.  Many games outright crashed even with the quick 
Win 2k Hotfixes released by M$.  Many games also needed compatibility patches 
direct from the game developers and some games never got fixed at all (even as 
of the year 2006).

    FYI, the game issues still haunt Win XP, as it is really "Win NT6" in 
disguise and is still not a true gaming or home OS regardless of the propaganda 
spewed by Microsoft.  Ok, so where the hell am I going with this?

    Well, the problems with the NT line of Kernels are one of many reasons why 
I and many others still stay loyal to the Win 9x line of Operating Systems.  
Personally, I still use Win 98 as my main OS for daily activities and gaming.  
While a few games, perhaps 25 maximum, up today's date of 03-19-2006, will only 
work on Win 2000 or Win XP, most games work perfectly on Win 98 or ME.  Chalk 
that up to the similarities of the 9x & NT Kernel lines and the various degrees 
of backward and forward compatibilities between the OS's.

    Lastly, this NFO is written in the year 2006.  We can still get the newest 
graphics and sound drivers made for Win 9x, along with the latest DirectX and 
OpenGL.  So, the Win 9x line of Kernels is still a viable option for PC gamers.


Crashing
~~~~~~~~
    Finally, we return the problem with the cracks done by other scene groups.  
The issue is this my friends.  Every crack that we have tested to date will 
crash on various Operating Systems or under certain circumstances.  The 
problem is not the games.  I can not stress this enough!  If you launch the 
trial limited version of the game, it will run perfectly on all the Operating 
Systems listed as the System Requirements by the developer.  If you buy the 
game, it will similarly run fine on any of those OS.  However, the cracks will 
not!  I don't give two fucking shits if they run fine on only one OS such as 
Win XP.  I don't give a damn if a larger portion of the gaming community is now 
using XP.  The cracks are just not done correctly at all.

    The reasons why they are crashing are many and varied, which will be 
addressed in the next paragraph.  It is not just this protection either; there 
are lots of other bad releases in the scene.  Most of these *bad crack* issues 
are coming from programs that use executable packers, encryptors, compressors, 
or protectors which require you to unpack and re-construct what you think might 
have been the original executable before it was packed.  If your release does 
not work on the Operating Systems that the developer fully supports, then is it 
not the right (or nay, even the duty) of a competing group to create a fully 
working one?  We think the answer is: 
Yes!

    And this is what QUALITY is all about.  The scene ~used~ to value this term.

    Alright, so the crashes?

    Bear in mind that most of these cracks by other groups  ~seem~  to work 
~so far as we saw~  on Win XP.  However, they are still not done correctly 
*AT ALL*, as they are linked to specific DLL versions or memory offsets of one 
OS (usually XP).  They can crash under many circumstances, such as on different 
Service Packs of XP, different languages of Windows, or even Future Windows 
Operating Systems.

    Observe some samples of the error messages:

    Win 9x: "XXX.EXE is linked to missing export KERNEL32.DLL:RestoreLastError."

    Win 2k: "The xxx loader could not load a missing export in KERNEL32.DLL to 
            RestoreLastError."

    Win *ALL*: "XXX has caused a page fault at offset xxxxxxxx and must be 
               closed"

    Reasons for crashing?

    * Improper re-constructions of the TARGET game that was encrypted and 
      imbedded within the protection.  This is the result of a poor 
      understanding of what exactly the protection has done to the original 
      TARGET or poor cracking skill or poor knowledge of the Windows PE 
      executable format.

    * API Import tables pulled from a running process on a new version of 
      Windows (such as Win XP).  The imports are basically functions that are 
      not part of the TARGET game itself.  When the game wants to draw a 
      triangle on your screen, it may not do so by itself.  Instead it will 
      call a 'DrawTriangle' function (sub-routine) of a DirectX.DLL file.  This 
      way it is easier for a developer to code a game by minimizing the work 
      they have to do.  "Just let the DLLs do all the work, and it will also be 
      compatible with all versions of Windows.  So that is less testing I need 
      to do to be sure my game runs without crashing for all of my customers."

      But the problem is that DLL files call other DLL files and they can be 
      at different versions on different editions of Windows and even on 
      different Service Packs of the same Windows Version.  If you "rebuild" 
      the imports in an amateurish way on Windows XP, then chances are very 
      high that your TARGET will not run on Win 95/98/ME and frequently not 
      even on Win 2000 or Win NT.  But wtf you say!?!?!  "I am just a humble 
      ~newbie~ cracker on Win XP, and I don't run Win 98.  So how can I 
      possibly do it correctly!?!?"  Read the ~~~Competition~~~ section below.

    * Hard-coded memory offsets or stack related info, directly attached to 
      a specific edition of Windows.  These cause Invalid Page Faults or Stack 
      Overflows or Exceptions.  And yes there are ways to do it correctly so it 
      works for every end user's system.


Releases
~~~~~~~~
    Realize that we are going to fix every last broken crack, including some 
that are almost 1 year old.  Why you ask?  Because games have a unique 
situation in the release world.  Applications frequently get weekly version 
updates, which is why we have a Minor Update rule in the 0day scene.  We want 
to prevent a flood of pointless minor changes that no one realistically needs.  
However, many games only get released once by a developer and see no updated 
versions ever.

    So, there will be games in peoples' 0day archives that are permanently 
broken because those are the final versions the developer will ever make.  Even 
10 Years from now, those releases will still be the only ones available.  We 
want to provide you with a fully working release to stand the test of time (and 
that will ~definitely~ work on future Windows versions as well).

    Most of these TNT releases will be labeled 'WORKING'.  Some may have 
'READ_NFO' also, and most of those are related to incorrect version numbers 
listed by our competing groups.  If you wonder why I use the real ver of 1.3.22 
in place of the competition's ver of 1.0, then consider this.  It is to prevent 
future dupes from us and other groups.  It may seem a little anal and probably 
is, but I feel that having the best possible version listed is most helpful to 
the scene.  Still, I do understand that finding the version can be difficult 
sometimes, which is why both TNT and other groups just use "v1.0" for any 
program that is brand new if they could not locate a version anywhere.

    Finally, I shall explain our delay in releasing all of these games.  If you 
check out all of our READ_NFO releases (do "site dupe read nfo -tnt"), you will 
see us complaining about bad cracks in many of our DOX releases.  Unlockers & 
Cheat Codes.  We ranted and raved that the games did not work on Win 9x and 
possibly not on Win 2000 either.  I am just one cracker in TNT.  But I knew how 
to crack that protection too, even way back at our first READ_NFO releases.  I 
held off on making the PROPERS & WORKINGS because I wanted to find a "better" 
way to crack those games.  That is to say better than even those ones we are 
about to PRE.  But alas, time is not on my side, so I am going to dump these 
working releases even though it is not the 'best' way to crack them.  
Nonetheless, they fucking work!  So, I say that it is good enough "for now"...


End Users
~~~~~~~~~
    You get a game from us that is guaranteed to work on any Operating System 
that you use, including future ones yet to be released.  While the cracks from 
our competing release groups may not work on various HotFixes, Service Packs, 
languages, etc of many Windows Editions.

    Also, the main deal that I feel is most important is the ability to play on 
Win 98 and Win ME finally!  Unfortunately, no other group has made a crack to 
function on our OS!  Still, if you like the game, think about buying it.  
These developers are shareware-level game authors.  They don't have world-wide 
store distribution or multi-million dollar budgets.  They rely on sales from 
people like us to make a living, doing something they probably love, which is 
creative computer programming.  Plus, they need to see support from the gaming 
community to inspire them to create more games for everyone to enjoy.

    So share the wealth.  You played the game.  You know it was enjoyable.  
I know you wouldn't want some weirdo coming over to your house and filling up a 
backpack with half of the food in your refrigerator.  Or taking the pictures 
off your wall and just walking right out with them.  When you realize that 
someone put a lot of hard work and many months of their life into a game that 
you really had fun with, how can you not reward them for their efforts?


Nukers
~~~~~~
    Go read the ~~~Releases~~~ section above, as that relates to you as well.  
Be aware that "rules" in the scene are meant to be guidelines to keep the scene 
stable & free from junk and chaos.  They are not absolutes and there is room 
for interpretation & exceptions to a rule.  Our cracks are fully WORKING, 
whereas the cracks of every last competing group are broken.  While most of 
theirs do work on Win XP, many do not work on Win 2000.  And none what-so-ever, 
will work on Win 98 or Win ME.  We can envision many potential bull-shit nuke 
reasons of our releases:

    "Go home TNT.  no one uses Win 98 / ME / 2k anymore."

    "It is ok if it only works on Win XP.  Because that is M$'s latest and 
     **laugh** greatest OS."

    "Unnecessary.  Just upgrade to XP.  TNT sucks."

    "xxx's (the other group's) crack works fine for most people."

    "Win 9x is no longer supported by M$.  So the scene does not support it."

    "Old.  Previous release was 6+ months ago."

    "As long as it runs on Win XP and Win 2k, that is good enough!"

    Well those are pitiful excuses.  Hell, Win ME (a Win 9x line of OS) is 
even NEWER than Windows 2000, and thus MUST be supported by the scene.  The 
cracks are just flat-out broken and not done correctly.  What will you do when 
they fail to run on the next edition of Windows after XP?  Or when you find out 
months later that people using Chinese or Japanese Windows XP editions have the 
same crashes?  Oh, but then you nuked our working one?  Think about your 
actions and how they effect the users of the software that is released in the 
scene.  Ok?

    And why aren't any of those badly cracked releases nuked yet?  Because 
nukers these days do not do their jobs, which is downloading and testing 
releases.  Some releases out there don't even work on any OS at all and are 
completely busted.  But yet, they remain not nuked.

    So you wonder how you can be sure that our claims are true and that our 
cracks are fully working, while the competitions' are not?  In my opinion, the 
easiest way is to boot into a Windows 98 or Windows ME system and try both of 
the cracks.  See which one crashes and which one works.  That should be 'nuf 
said.  It is the easiest and most consistent way to observe the problems with 
the competitions' cracks, since none of them work on Win 9x.  But you don't 
have a Win9x boot?  Well why not?  What kind of 'proper' self-respecting nuker 
does not have multiple boots to be able to correctly do their job, which is 
verifying that a release really works as it should.  You are not a script meant 
to hap-hazardously run "site nuke" commands, nor a bot to sheepishly mirror the 
nukes (and Nuke Reasons) of other sites or other nukers; you are a release 
TESTER!  That is your job on a site.  It is what you get paid for.  So do it!

    Once you discover the bad cracks made by other groups, we expect to see 
their releases nuked for reasons such as:

    - not.fully.working

    - bad.crack

    - broken.crack

    - crashes

    - get.TNT.WORKING

    - get.TNT.PROPER

    You might want to read the first paragraph of the ~~~Competition~~~ 
section below.  We are listing all of the groups that did bad cracks on this 
protection.  It's worth a look.


Competition
~~~~~~~~~~~
    As was said in the beginning, I address the 'noble' competition directly 
here.  First, for you nukers, here is a list of the groups that have attempted 
to crack this protection.  They have failed however.

    - EXPLOSiON
    - CSS
    - DVT
    - ALiAS
    - ENGiNE
    - DiViNE
    - Lz0
    - DELiGHT

    Quick flame right now.  ENGiNE is a complete disgrace of a group.  Most of 
their releases are old Graphics Plugins from like 4 years ago.  And most have 
fake version numbers.  Like they will go put out 1.0.2, when the latest is 
really 1.0.1.  So you check their fake 1.0.2 and oh my god, it has got 100% 
duplicate files of 1.0.1 from 3 years ago!  What a bunch of lamers.  And btw, 
stay away from ActiveMark, because it is way, WAY out of your league.  Idiots.

    For Zen balance I will counter the above with a polite comment.  DELiGHT.  
While your ISO-games friends helped you get very close to fixing the cracks on 
this, it was still not good enough.  But...  You came a hell of a lot closer 
than all of the other groups.  So congratulations!  You are just a hair away 
from a fully working crack.  DVT and the rest are so off page that it is 
laughable.  And for DELiGHT, your Boonty Protected games DO work fine on all OS 
that we tested.  So, very good job there fella's.

    If any decent groups want to speak with us about what they are doing wrong, 
we may offer assistance.  But, you better at least know a good deal about what 
you are doing and about the protection.

    I realize that most of the other groups have no idea that their cracks are 
broken, because they only tried them on 1 or 2 Win XP systems.  They don't 
bother to test upon other OS, like the older more established crackers of the 
scene do.  Unfortunately, that will be your downfall.  I know the scene no 
longer holds to the ideals of quality and high standards that it once did in 
the past, such as in the 80's and 90's.  But still, we at TNT are trying to 
maintain a level of consistency toward quality, fully working releases.  It is 
sad that very few groups seem to care anymore.

    For all groups, it is the hard-coded offsets in your files that will stop 
them from ever working on Win 9x systems and could possibly cause them to fail 
on new version of Windows (sequels to XP), depending on how M$ is changing the 
OS.  Realize the original protected files would still run, so it is just your 
cracking that is faulty.  Sorry, but it's true.  Suck it up, drop the ego, and 
embrace defeat.  Next, for most of the groups (except DELIGHT), your import 
tables are not properly coded and it causes crashing on all Win 9x systems 
*and* even on Win 2000 too!

    Ok, so how to fix the imports?  Well here is where Win 9x comes to the 
rescue.  Simply do what you did on XP, but do it on a Win 9x system and you 
will get the correct DLL names and functions.  If you are a new boy and Win XP 
is your first OS and you never heard of Win 98 / Win ME until I just mentioned 
it, then you will need to learn the Windows PE format and study the protection 
code very hard.  It is possible to watch the LoadLibary calls in the protection 
and also the function name relocations being dynamically linked into the game.

    The protection is HARD-CODING the offset of the imports linked directly to 
the OS it is running upon.  Nonetheless, you can make a crack that works on all 
OS using only Win XP.  But you will need to understand what the protection is 
doing and why.

    We have not fully removed the protection from these games.  Then again, 
neither has any of the competition.  While it is possible, there are many 
details to work out, which means a tremendous time investment to fully 
understand the protection and to create re-construction tools.  That was our 
delay in making these Working Proper releases, which makes a few of the games 
over 6 months old.  Some people will surely raise an eyebrow of suspicion as to 
why it "took so long."  Well, it turns out that the protection is quite a bit 
more advanced than I initially thought.


Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~
    For those who wonder, the ActiveMark version is 5.XX for all of our 
releases.  The exact version numbers are varied, but it is still the Fifth 
Edition of the protection.  Difference do exist between each of those minor 
version updates of 5.XX edition, which resulted in different crack methods for 
many of the games.  There were also many earlier versions years ago and while I 
have not looked at any of them myself, I can only assume that this latest 5.XX 
release is the most heavily protected.  And 5.XX has never had a truly good 
crack made yet either.

    All, fully working ActiveMark releases by TNT are coming.  Here is how we 
are doing this (barring any technical difficulties).  5 hours after this 
release is PRED, we will start with our properly cracked games, with each one 
maybe 5 minutes apart for courier fun.  They will be released in 3 batches on 
three different days.

    Day #1 = The release we are making a proper of is less than 30 days old

    Day #2 = The release we are making a proper of is 30 days to 180 days old

    Day #3 = The release we are making a proper of is over 180 days old

    * I feel that is a good method which caters to nukers on strict sites.

    After that we will wait at least one more day, and then start putting out 
brand new games protected by ActiveMark or some slightly older ones that were 
not yet released.  For those curious minds out there, these games were not all 
cracked in a single day.  The cracks are all "date stamped" to the same day for 
security reasons.  It took MANY, MANY days to get all of these cracked.

    If any more broken releases were missed or overlooked by mistake, then they 
will get propered later on, as they are discovered.

    I suggest that the competition either fixes their crack methods or stops 
making releases all together.  Because we will continue to proper you if you 
make any more bad cracks.  This is not meant as an attack on the competition.  
We just want the Scene to have some working games and hell, *I* would like some 
working ones myself for *my* own preferred OS of Win 98.

Ok?  Thank you!
