Greetings,

I am the cracker who patched the asr securom loader for procyon.
All I did was renaming the module it inserts in the game process!
This means ASR still does belong to its rightful owner  and
NOT to procyon.. or should I say CRIME?

So what is this all about?
It's about revenge! The group procyon aka crime tried to mix up
with another group and getting their trust. But in the end THEY
STOLE A SUPPLY FROM THEM! Ofcourse they got kicked of their HQs :P

Anyway this loader is free to use for everyone who hates PROCYON!

AND

All procyon 'securom loader propers' were NOT valid!
Nuke that sjjjiiit.

Over and out.
