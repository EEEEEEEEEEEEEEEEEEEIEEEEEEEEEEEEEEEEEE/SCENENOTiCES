Hi today I make it short.

Site changed IP again to different IP range now. Here are new IPs
91.82.110.83
91.82.110.84
91.82.110.85
91.82.110.86

hostname fusionring.hopto.org also works

And looks like site now accepts only connections from hungarian ip adresses.

Check proofs dir to see this paysite is still alive.
