Thanks goes to AntiP2P for their involvement getting the P2P retards out in the open. After 
the release of hluserlist.txt I started going trough my site comparing the ip's to the userdb. I soon
realized this was gonna be a huge task, since the hluserlist.txt includes more than 300 ip's. Therefor
I made this script doing most of the job.

Consider this as a contribution to the latest news, to help the siteops out there eliminating users
being a major security issue on their sites. This script will compare the users at your site towards
the ip's listed in hluserlist.txt.

The format of hluserlist.txt is assumed to be like this:
'User: [BBB]some_nick - Range: [192.168.4.0-192.168.4.255]'
 
Heads up! Script will only use 3 parts of the ip while searching (123.123.123.*),
so keep that in mind if you find a match for any of your users.


Read the script for additional information.









To all P2P involved l337 sceners: BURN IN HELL.
