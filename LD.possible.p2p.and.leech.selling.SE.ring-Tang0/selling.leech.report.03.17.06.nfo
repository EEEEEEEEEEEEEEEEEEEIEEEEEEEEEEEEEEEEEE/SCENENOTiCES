I've sent this notice out because a site ring siteop has attempted to sell me leech
for 150$USD. The Ring is known has BNK at Link-net. Also I think the scene shouldn't be offering to sell leech for any purpose.
This took place at 5:49PM CST. I've kept my identity unknown for my own protection.
I've included a screen shot of the siteop offering me leech.
For All you siteops selling leech. This is bad business for everyone. please rethink who your offering leech to next time ;)
Thank you for taking your time to read this notice
