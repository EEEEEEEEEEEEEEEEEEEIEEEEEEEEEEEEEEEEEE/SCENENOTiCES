Hello everyone.

We decided to release this note after reading the nfo
of Smallville.S06E03.HR.HDTV.AC3.5.1.XviD.READ.NFO-NBS.
NBS announced that from now on they're going to cut all the
black screens between commercials, and the "re-caps" at the beginning
of episodes. they claim to do it for the "benefit of the viewer".

well, WE URGE YOU *NOT* to do it!
When we thought about it, we yelled NO!!!!!!
If you'll go on with this, the viewer will SUFFER, not benefit.
the "Previously on *SHOW*", is REALLY important, since it can include
old scenes from many episodes back, so that you'll know that it somehow
connects to the new episode.
the black screens between commercials are also important, we don't want a
ultra-fast move between scenes.
don't forget, the DVDs will include both the intros and the black screens.
that's how whoever makes the shows WANTS us to watch it.
Please don't do it, I don't want to pray that any group but NBS will win
the race everytime a show I love is about to pre.

Another thing, if we already make a note.
Some groups release HR as 960x544, and some as 960x528.
Lets put an end to it.
for a perfect aspect ratio for HR, one would use 960x540, right?
but it's not allowed, since 540 cannot divide with 16.
528 and 544 can.
960x544 gives us 1.76 ar - which is VERY close to 960x540 (16:9)
960x528 gives us 1.81 ar - BIGGER ar error.
Why not use 960x544 all the time?
it's the closest AR possible, and best for viewing pleasure on 16:9 screens.

Thank you for reading, hopefully some good will come out of this note.
