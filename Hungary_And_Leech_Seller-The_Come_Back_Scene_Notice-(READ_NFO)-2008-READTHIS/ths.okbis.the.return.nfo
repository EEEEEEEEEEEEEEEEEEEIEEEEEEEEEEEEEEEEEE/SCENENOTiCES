Hungary.And.Leech.Seller.The.Come.Back.Scene.Notice.2008

--------------------------------------------------------


First of all I feel kinda sorry to do this kind of stuff, but there's something important that users should know.

Site name: THS
Box Owner: Shemale
Location: Hungary
Link: 1 GBit
BNC: 79.172.201.3 (yeah bad to leak this kind of stuff but read what's coming next)
HOST: Szervernet Ltd
Affil: MiiiX

I rather not name others staff members, neither racers, or users on this site, they are all french lamers, which 
shouldn't get too much attention.

Taking new groups first of all proves how much this site is kinda insecure without knowing who they really are and 
stuff like that. But anyways whatever it's not my business



-A- INSECURE BOXOWNER:

So Anyways who's that "Shemale" guy let's have a look on his whois

[1] AT THE MOMENT
•››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››› ››››› ››› ›› ›› ›› › ›
Whois report for (Shemale) (admin@LinkNet-9347fa9929.1phone.hu)
• Name: Shemale
• Channels: &servers
•››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››› ››››› ››› ›› ›› ›› › ›

[2] 10 Days Ago[!] (which was just few days before people noticed that it was him)
•››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››› ››››› ››› ›› ›› ›› › ›
Whois report for (Shemale) (OkBiS@LinkNet-a948012cb5.catv.broadband.hu)
• Name: OkbiS
• Channels: &servers
•››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››› ››››› ››› ›› ›› ›› › ›

[3] 2 Months Ago[!]
•››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››› ››››› ››› ›› ›› ›› › ›
Whois report for (OkBiS) (okbis@87.229.256.256)
• Name: OkbiS
• Channels: &servers
•››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››››› ››››› ››› ›› ›› ›› › ›

So basically Shemale = OkbiS, but he had to change ident bnc but kept his nick (you shouldn't have been too much lazy)
when the rumors was started to being spread, that it was him. Anyways for you who don't know this guy, his last 2 sites got busted
I'll not name them, but our dear friends OkbiS is also pretty famous as one of the biggest Leech seller of the mp3 scene.
It was proved several times. But it seems people are enough dumb to still trust him. 



-B- REALLY INSECURE LINK:

Since you guys prolly now traced the bnc, which is also the passv ip of the site (once again pretty insecure stuff), I wanted to google
the server host, so let's google it: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Szervernet+Ltd%22

So Basically a site which the ip could be find on google, which kind of monkey or donkey could run that stuff ?

Prolly some pretty much insecure, I'm asking siteops of every secure link to be sure none of these donkeys we gave 
out infos (affil(s), boxowner) not being on your site.

Although this is a french section based site, I wanted to point of the come back of the biggest leech-seller of 
our good damn scene.

Peace.
