CINEMA 4D UPGRADE ONLY V8.5 *WORKING NON STOLEN* (c) MAXON

date: DEC 27TH 2003
type: 3D
size: 1X15

Description:

You might have wondered why the Maxon Cinema4D 8.5 Releases by PDX/PNT 
got nuked. Simple Reason:

Two weeks ago the fairly prominent leader of Paradox approached me 
(DWP leader), as usual, to talk about C4D 8.5, after a while he told me that 
Maxon held an Anti-Piracy Workshop to find a solution against the releases
of their software, since their sales apparently stagnated. So they introduced 
a new serial scheme for 8.5, which was honestly plain dumb, since their 
original 8.x and modules schemes were fairly advanced. Both the PDX leader and
I agreed on not releasing the 8.5 Update for several weeks if not months, as 
probably everyone understands we don't want to be the reason that a Company 
files for insolvency, just because we release their applications. I gave PDX 
a set of serials for internal testing (so their members can play around with 
8.5). I honestly don't know what made PDX to break the internal agreement
and release the App with my serials (without further inquiry). That's why 
their releases got nuked as stolen.serial/not allowed to use crack for release. 

Apparently having some release done is more important than to maintain the 
jobs of Maxon's staff.

Installation:

Anyway, this is the same serial set as the PDX one including a jpeg as a proof 
of my keygen.
