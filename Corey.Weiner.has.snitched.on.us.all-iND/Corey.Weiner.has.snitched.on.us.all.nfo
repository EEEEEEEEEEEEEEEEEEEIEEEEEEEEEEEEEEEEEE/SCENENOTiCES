Ok guys listen up..

Looks like the folks at SONY NBC, and JUNGROUP (www.jungroup.com) are still at it with thier video releases.  So far they have pre'd 2 releases into the scene which are available at www.welcometothescene.com

The.Scene.Episode.1.TV.XviD-SCENE

The.Scene.Episode.2.TV.XviD-SCENE

They have promised us a third release in January.

After a long conversation with 1and1 hosting I found that spoofing information on a web domain can result in loss of your domain. I took this into consideration when looking up the whois info for 2 domains 1 of which is www.welcometothescene.com and the other of www.jungroup.com putting both whois informations together they are both registered to the same person with the same name as the guy starring in the episode Corey Weiner 

Corey Weiner
65 Arleigh Rd Great Neck, NY 11021
516-466-7130

I decided to dig a little deeper the address in this whois information comes back to a Richard Weiner which to my knowledge belongs to Corey's Father. Richard (Corey's Father) has a different phone number then the one listed on Corey's domain information, but he apperently is living with his Father

Richard Weiner (Corey's Father)   
65 Arleigh Rd
Great Neck, NY 110211442 
Phone: 516-466-7175 

I once again contacted 1and1 hosting and asked if a phone number was invalid on a domain where I was unable to contact an administrator what would happen. He explained I could email abuse@1and1,com and they would then try to contact the administrator. If we were unable to contact the administrator they would have to remove the domain until valid information was provided 

I have come to the conclusion the phone numbers are valid
 
I would hate to see anyone do anything mean to Corey or his Father.  Please make sure you do not use this information for any wrong doing.  I would hate to see these numbers called at all hours of the night, or Cory's car being towed.  One wonders if the would then take the bus to work so that he can continue to snitch on us all

Corey wisely pulled his name off www.jungroup.com so there is no longer any information from him there.  

Corey Weiner is preing these videos into the scene and is a MAJOR DANGER to us all.  JunGroup is paying him for his knowlege of the scene and who knows who else has him on the payroll.  If anyone saw what site pre'd this into the database let people know.  Because Corey or some other snitch is on that site.

Corey Weiner ----> We KNOW who you are
