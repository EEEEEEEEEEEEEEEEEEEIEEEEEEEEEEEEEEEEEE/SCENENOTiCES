Ban GOW now!!!!!!!!

I recently saw a warning note about GOW. It was from some web cracker, who claimed
GOW stole releases from P2P/WEB and Torrents. Don't know if that is true or not,
but today i realized it might be true as they FOR SURE did steal the crack for
Line Rider 2 Unbound, who recently was released by JFKPC with no crack.

Proofs:

(1)

The crack was first posted here by UltimateGamer, who is the real author of the
crack.

Note: The webpage is under heavy load from people who wants the crack, so please be
      patient if it does not load right away.


(2)

Some hours later the crack appeared on several torrents. Look at this one:

http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/1654118/6201776/

This has a timeline, so you can see when the torrent was posted and it updates by
the hour, so that means you get a pretty accurate timeline by the hour of when the
post was made.

I have included the original release by UltimateGamer, which proves it's the
exactly same exe file. Try and compare it with the GOW release!


(4)

The cracked exe by UltimateGamer is packed with UPX, which is an exe file packer,
that reduces the exe size.

Which should make you wonder why GOW choose to pack their exactly same byte by byte
crack and then use UPX to pack it, exactly the same choice of packer like UltimateGamer also used. Why?


(5)

The REAL author of the crack is UltimateGamer and not GOW, as GOW has no crackers.
The people behind GOW are just an console group, who decided to rename/build their
PC section with a new name. Maybe in cause they got caught stealing, then their
console divisions wont get hurt.


Anyway, BAN this lame group NOW!

GOW = Thieves!
