Siteops, be aware of the user dbd, dbd@baltasar.***.no.

Reportedly, he is trying to steal sites from rings to
other rings to benefit in leechaccounts, or whatever.

This was discovered when a user in question was siteop
at a ring he tried to steal a site from, and was a racer
at the ring he tried to get the site to.

Be very aware of this user, take all precautions necessary,
we don't need buttplugs like him here.
