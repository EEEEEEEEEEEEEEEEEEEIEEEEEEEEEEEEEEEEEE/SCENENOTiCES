I'll go straight to the point.
After few discussions it seems the latest information I (aka -WEB) wrote under -PROOF are wrong.
Even if I don't have the answers of everything, at least I had clarifications on the main points, and I will deal with that.
For these mistakes, I have to apologize towards the people who felt insulted, such as 320 and WAV.
The judgements of my previous notices were wrong, certainly biased, or their formulations were inadequate,
letting things esclalate to a hallucinating point. I admit there was a bit of bitterness under this 'little war' on my side,
but the story is never black or white...
So, I know I will have much people bouncing of happyness in reading this, but yes, WEB lost (once again some will say) the 'war',
and as a collateral damage, dies as you read this. Woohoo!!! The room for WEB was already tiny (btw chosen by purpose) but now,
it seems many people are indignated by what has been done, so as you guy say, I will now 'hide like a rat' again.
Some even say I have spit on what fed me. To those, I think they did not know my dedication in the past, and they simply don't know
what they are talking about, or at least a very few people will.
But my worst deception does not come from the fact WEB dies, or that I was wrong. This is only a microevent on the scene scale.
It comes from how serious this story turned with some people. And I don't speak about the scene. I have done mistakes lately, but when I
figured out some were concerned by things that even does not exist, I know I am not the only one who did mistakes in my judgements.
So, let me have my latest words after a very long time in the releasing activity, thanks for ones who helped/supported me along the years.
I had much fun, especially at the begginning. No names, or I'd risk to put the dirt on them as well... I also had 'bad beats' and huge deceptions,
like now. That's how life works.
Bye WEB/PROOF
