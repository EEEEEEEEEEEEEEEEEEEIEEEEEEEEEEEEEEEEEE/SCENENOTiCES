* Notice to all DVDR groups:

We wrote this nfo on behalf of many many users,
For the ones who are releasing PAL dvds, that usually have
10+ subtitles.
99% of the groups remove most of the subs, and we have to wait a very
long time for the MULTISUB pal dvdr.
subtitles are what? 2mb max? or less.
we are requesting that you will not remove all of the subtitles from
the dvd releases.
thanks
