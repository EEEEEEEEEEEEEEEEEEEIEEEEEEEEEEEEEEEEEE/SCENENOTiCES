  ##	This notice is a long time in the making and I don't even know where 
  ##	to begin to be honest. Theres so much to say about the past 6 years 
  ##	that Pisexy has existed. Lets start off with a history lesson shall 
  ##	we? Pimpie, the owner of Pisexy was originally a developer for a 
  ##	well-known site called 123Torrents (later renamed TiT [TorrentIt]), 
  ##	things were good there for a while, till Pimpie and a few other 
  ##	uploaders/members abandoned that ship and started their own site as 
  ##	"revenge" called ABCTorrents later renamed Pisexy. There some low-level 
  ##	drama happened, Wild from WildBytes a great person, found out that 
  ##	Pimpie was having his duplicate site accounts in draws and "winning" 
  ##	them so he didnt have to give the rightful winners any prizes. Wild 
  ##	also from talking to Pimpie learned of how he cleared $10,000/month
  ##	(and this was back in 2005, most big sites can clear that easily these 
  ##	days but back in the day, $10,000 from a torrent site was incredible). 
  ##	Wild left and started his own site, which operated properly and was 
  ##	run legitimately. Pimpie kept exploiting his users and the site itself 
  ##	into a money maker. One year a thirteen week draw was held, for dvd 
  ##	boxsets and then finally a gaming laptop, over 23,000 tickets were sold
  ##	to the userdatabase at the time of  28,000 users at 5 usd each, 
  ##	$115,000 USD in about 3 months. On top of their draws at pisexys peak, 
  ##	it had a stable 1500 users on a VIP subscription at 7.95 for the first 
  ##	month and 12 USD recurring every 30 days. So $11925 in the pocket and
  ##	$18000/month so from VIP subscriptions their total was over $227,000+ 
  ##	just from VIP subscriptions. But the site has gone downhill since its 
  ##	peak, it went from around 30,000 users to around 10. This has drastically
  ##	reduced the amount of income that pimpie received so they did the next 
  ##	best thing. Since the site now contained around 10,000 long time stable 
  ##	members, it was time to take them for all they had. Lets fake a death now
  ##	everyone. On August 26th if I recall correctly, Pimpie faked his death and
  ##	had the users of his site pay for his "fake funeral" but this actually went
  ##	to the new led tv he purchased, the users of the site have trusted in Pisexy
  ##	for a long time and have not had any reason to not trust pisexy and this was
  ##	their fall. Pimpie has cleared over half a million dollars thanks to PiSexy's
  ##	total possible database size of over 240,000 users over 6 yrs, and he got away.
  ##	Still think pimpie is dead? Err call his house #, ask for Robert, he answered.
  ##	I've already called and gotten ahold of him, this is just incredibly sad, that no
  ##  one has taken the chance to phone him.

  ## William a fantastic uploader, also known as TownDrunk and Princess, is addicted to cocaine, why?
  ## Because of pimpie, he found Williams weakness, and makes him sit at home uploading instead of working, having a life, 
  ## and pays him to run the site which ofc he uses on Cocaine to stay alert all day.
  ## 
  ## Ricochet is a power hungry little pusshole, he doesnt have the respect of any of the staff,
  ## he thinks he is all power and mighty but everyone just laughs at him, like the time he posted a picture of a really bad
  ## snow day and said it was his neighbourhood, only to shown by another member that its not his neighbour its something he stole
  ## off the internet ahaha, also the time he thought Scene Releases should have a bitrate attached and if not, it should be the uploaders job
  ## to get it and add it to the description.. dude who are you kidding? its a scene release. Some staffers left after that 
  ## and made their own site, TheCandyStore? It was a failure of course, the staff on Pisexy have no idea how to properly run a site.
  ## 
  ## Respects to the good guys of PiSexy though, William of course, MaxTheSilent, Wild, Sturner16, JackDaniels, Zeustke165, etc. You know who you are..
