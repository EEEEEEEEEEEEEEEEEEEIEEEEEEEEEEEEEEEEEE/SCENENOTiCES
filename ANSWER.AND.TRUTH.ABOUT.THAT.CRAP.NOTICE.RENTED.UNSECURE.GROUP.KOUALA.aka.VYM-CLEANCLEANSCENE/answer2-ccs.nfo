Today I've just read one more crap against us called that time "RENTED.UNSECURE.GROUP.KOUALA.aka.VYM-CLEANSCENE"

So I think it's time to explain you again...

[hint: sentences with >> are those who should come in that -CLEANSCENE nfomaker brain during reading if he is not that dumb... ]
 
 
1) Yes VYM took releases from PROMO BLOGS AND that's why VYM was STOPPED (not BUSTED).
   >>YOU SEE YOU SEE JUST WHAT I SAID 

   
 
2) Yep one of KOUALA leaders is french, nop thanks for his ass he's not a faggot. 
   (Or maybe you got proofs of that too? Since you got "amazing and 100% trustable WORD proofs" of everything linked to him but no -proof.jpg (like we did for our releases) ... 
   Maybe you can try to show any REAL proofs you got on KOUALA sometimes instead of saying VYMVYMVYM again ?)
   >>DOH I CAN'T :[
  
3) KOUALA was created after VYM stopped. Yep, and that's the only thing i can agree with you, because KOUALA NEVER DID BLOGS NOR WHATEVER YOU WANT SHIT so her is the first reason to stop crying.
   How can that be explained ? Maybe because there is only one guy from VYM who's still in KOUALA and maybe because that guy was legit and provide for every fucking cd he bought a fucking proof? (like every other member)
   Have you tried to look that way? no fucking sucker, sure you've not...
   >>WAIT WHAT??? SHIT I'M LAME AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT A MEMBER IN AN OLD TEAM CAN COME BACK AND BE LEGIT WITH A NEW TEAM :O I SUCK SRSLY I'M A FAGGOT AND GOT PROOFS THAT I AM LOL

   
4) Some KOUALA rippers have been recruited by this hushmail account and some others by friends (yep, WE got friends, and WE got a life instead of you) 
   You never used email for recruiting? Damn you so leet. *APPLAUSE* but we're not all like you...
   Did you know that instead of using a secure .edu proxy like you to connect on ftp (hey see my turn to say my *TRUSTABLE* crap infos that's so easy..), Mr french leader know how to use at least a bnc on mirc and a http proxy to check his mails. 
   >>COOL LOL
   
   Also do you know how hard KOUALA is for giving a trial to new members ? Sure you dont know.
   #1 no noob who has never rip before
   #2 no access to topsite during trial
   #3 We always ask to new members to provide proofs of how legit they are by giving us buying proofs on webstore (for every release they pack in their month of trial) and dvd scans, cd scans, vinyl scans for every release anyway.
   
   I have nothing to say about your fanciful story of hacked card numbers. Maybe you can write a book you seems to have so much imagination.. Please give me more "word proofs" for that.
   >>AH I SEE.. SO NOBODY GAVE THEIR CREDIT CARD NUMBER BY EMAIL LOL?
   
   No, you really think that some guys wanna give their credit card number like that? (besides you i mean...)
   >>HMM... YOU HIT ME
   
   What's your problem seriously ? We did some -WEB- releases nor -RETAIL- before you so you are anguished ? or we propered you ? Seriously... boy, please shut your fucking mouth.
   >>SHIT SHIT SHIT THEY GROW I HATE THEM I HATE THEM I'M GONNA DO NFO SURE I AM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT LOL I'LL DO THAT NEW NFO WITH THESE OLD ONES AGAINST VYM LOOOL THAT'LL WORK LOLL !1!111!
   
   
5) We always pre stuff we love. Who the fuck are you to say that a release you don't like is crap ?
   >>I LOOKS LIKE GOD BUT I SMELL, SPEAK AND ACT LIKE SHIT SO CHOOSE WHAT I AM.
        
   OK that one is free but it feels good here.

   
6) About these rented sites that you seems know better than us.. 
   For your information, KOUALA is not affiliated in .fr country at all. Your informations looks again wrong. 
   You talked also about affiliating .us sites.. Guy, KOUALA just never affiliated on .us sites nor .kr sites so one more crap information... phew.. 
   Finally for that .nl, we were on it before and he looks more like a dedicated i3d site than like a rented leaseweb site as you have written... learn2traceip maybe but anyway enjoy we've lost it because of you.
   >>SHIT I'M SO GOOD
   

7) We're fucking not her for business nor for war or fighting with others.. 
   We're her for listening that fucking good music and we'll never stop because of a hater !!!!!
   
   Do your releases and leave us do ours, that's what we did fine now in KOUALA for near than 2 years and we'll do that much much longer trust me.
   
Peace to all except YOU

I hope to never heard from you again,
Regards,

K.
