------------------NOTICE TO ALL UK TOPSITES--------------------------

We have an informent who has told us that the UK Police went into a
UK datacentre today, im not sure whether the datacentre said its ok
to do this or whether they need a warrant to be able to do this.

The police were looking for spikes in traffic on the servers at the
exact time things were pre'd, not sure what if anything they found.
Apparently they do this quite regularly and give the datacentre owner
a phone call 1-2 days before to let them know they are coming.

Just thought we would let you UK site owners and groups who use UK
sites know that this goes on if you didnt already know this.

Stay careful guys and Long Live The Scene!
