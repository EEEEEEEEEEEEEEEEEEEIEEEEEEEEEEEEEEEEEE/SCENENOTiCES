If that is not enough for you. Just go to each torrent they 
have re-encoded, which is the last unnuked 8 releases. Look 
who’s name shows up on each snatchlist.

Coincidence? I think not. Here is his IP also for those
sites out there who affil this group. You are allowing

sites as well as wasting your time and bandwidth with
re-encodes. Match this IP the user and/or sitelog.
