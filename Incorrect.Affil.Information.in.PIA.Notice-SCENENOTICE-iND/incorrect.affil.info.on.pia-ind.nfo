     Release Notes. . .
   
      This is a follow up to the latest scene notice!!!  It had extremely incorrect information in it regarding affils of PIA.
      Not only does C4DVD have no affiliation with PIA but also the following groups that we are able to confirm:  iNDiCA,
      SNO, GTL, and W4F. Also in PIA site chan now (after speaking to someone who will remain anonymous) when you type !affils
      it says Look for Pres instead of listing who all affils the site. Their will be a follow up ascii with more people who 
      were wrongfully listed as affiling the site when we get them. Thanks and lets just rehash what c4dvd said in their ascii.
      We have no need for those kind of sites.  We just dont have the tolerance for that. These groups are secure and only seek
      to provide the scene with high quality releases. We do not support or condone affiliating sites that have been accused of
      selling leech or on boxes thats are from resellers and colo. So on that note goodbye and enjoy these groups releases
      as we keep pumping the scene with good releases. Also we can confirm that mVs also no longer affils this site. Goodbye!
