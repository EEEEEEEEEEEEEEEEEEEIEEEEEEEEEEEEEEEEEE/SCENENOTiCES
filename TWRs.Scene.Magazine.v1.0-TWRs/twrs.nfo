		Well what a interesting day today. Not only has it been proven today that the scene has lost
          alot of the creditability it used to have but people have even gone so far to rat out Siteops that 
          trusted them enough to add them to their sites. Sure it might be a colo it might not be that was
          exploited by these people who claim they are doing good. There are other ways to get rid of the
          trash groups. One way is to just not support the site yourself there is no need to bring everyone
          else into it. The couriers on that site didnt choose to have that affil but they were choosen for that
          site.
                Now I do agree that the person who is releasing these scene notices with site info is definately
          doing something that is just gonna hurt the scene even if its from a lower level. I mean obviously
          most the sites your talking about arent the highest on the totem pole but whos to blame for everyone
          being in the scene? Thats something everyone should sit back and think about. We let them in now
          people are trying to get them out of it. They wouldnt be here if no one would affil the sites or 
          curry to them or loan their prebots to the sites and worst of all if people would stop selling slots
          to people and giving the leech (thats another topic for another rainy day). 

          Now response to this nuker 
                 
                    "I personally have the power to nuke all these re-encoded releases -- it 
             appears the poster of that notice does not, so he thinks that by leaking loads of 
             information he is so fucking smart.. You are not, retard."
             
             First let me say one thing you are not the only one who has the power to nuke the re-encodes. Sure 
             nuke-networks (theres many out there now) can nuke them but it also goes down to the site nukers also.
             They have the power to do just as much as you can. Since it depends on them to get the release nuked
             unless you have a bot on the site that does your nuke-networks nuking on sites.


         Now the next topic at hand  that the last nuker before said 
  
                  "Check out some of the star wars 3 workprint/tc nukes"
             
             Ok now this topic is little rough on the edges some of these Star Wars 3 rips were considered                        re-encodes, but not all of them where. Some groups like TUN have expressed that they give 
             permission to AAV from french scene to use their ViDEO. Now the workprints showed up on p2p before
             it even showed up in the scene. There was even a sample of it on p2p 3 hours before -Visa even
             pred.



         We have gone a long ways over the years lost great friends to bullshit that is going on today in 
         the scene. It seems we came a long way from groups having public channels where they would openly
         distribute to anyone who stumbled upon their irc channel. And now we are almost going back to the same
         insecurity.
