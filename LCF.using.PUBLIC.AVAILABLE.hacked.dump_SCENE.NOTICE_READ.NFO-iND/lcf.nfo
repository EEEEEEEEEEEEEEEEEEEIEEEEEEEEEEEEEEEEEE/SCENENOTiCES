		From the producers of glftpd.plus.phpsysinfo.plus.google.AINT.SMART-(Several.sites.and-or.dumps)-READ.NFO-iND
			Now presenting "The truth about LCF!" - A followup production, one of MANY more to come!

						Sponsored by: google + a working brain


So, new day, new DEVESTATING findings, sadly.

We felt that the given example-query for google (or/and other search engines) should be explored more, and we were SHOCKED when we came to page 3
of the result-page.
We found what looks like a HACKED FreeBSB box running some sort of dumpsite.. but wait, the shit is mounted into a public_html dir.. figured it was
worth checking it out. As we feared; PUBLIC available via WEB!

But the shit didnt stop there, what we FOUND did. Really, it literally made me stop and look at the index.html's sourcecode to make sure. What we
found is what looks like unreleased LCF rls'.

Take a look at the original page that tipped us off: http://www.crispyserver.com/

Now take a look at that public_html dir via web: http://www.crispyserver.com/~elcx/lcf/rips/
(no google cache)

Extra shot; www.crispyserver.com.files.jpg


We also included a .zip with the folder structure + sfv + nfo intact for u to look at.


Conclusion: Draw one yourself, I think you're smart enough to know what to do with LCF and their users.


ps: WTF's up with http://www.crispyserver.com/~xbox360d/ ?
This is also available as xbox360degrees.jpg (original from web, only diff. is there's some text "Site coming soon... " below it at web.

pps: here's elcx's pastebin: http://www.crispyserver.com/~elcx/ GOD knows where it outputs shit, but feel free to send elcx/LCF messages via it ;)


Peace out!
