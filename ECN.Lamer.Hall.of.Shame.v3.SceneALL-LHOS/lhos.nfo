another group compromises scene security & quality.
Electrocution is carding releases. 

Everyone knows that the best way to get busted
and or draw more attention to our activities
is to start fucking around with stolen credit
cards. credit card company's get kinda rabid
about this shit. and they aren't stupid.

proof is documented below:

...pay attention ;p

==============================================================================

-> 051402
Antiy.Ghostbusters.Professional.Edition.v3.22.WinALL.Incl.Keyfilemaker-TMG

this is a legitimately reversed release...

At this time the keysize was 128 bits so it was possible to factor it but right 
after this release, the company changed the keysize to 4096 bits.

==============================================================================

-> 052203
Antiy.Ghostbusters.Professional.Edition.v3.70.WinALL.REGGED-ELiMiNATiON

the group is now dead and they admitted publically to having carded many 
releases. this was one of them...

==============================================================================

-> 111303
Antiy.Ghostbusters.Professional.Edition.v4.1.WinALL-ECN

As you can see these are both releases of Antiy Ghostbuster Professional Edition.
[ECN & ELIMINATION]
Unfortunately for these groups, this app is rather hard to keygen... 
or should I say was..since it's impossible to keygen it now that they have changed
the keysize to 4096 bits.


==============================================================================

I cannot stress too much : their keys can ONLY be CARDED.
Oh btw, don't tell me they bought it... ;]

Why are we letting these groups to compromise us
all and degrade the quality and ideals of the scene?

Collectively , the scene should enforce the prohibition of
insecure practices which degrade the quality and security
of the scene... It would be best to ban any group that is
found to be carding releases. 

To the QUALITY groups in the scene...perhaps refusing to pre on
sites with KNOWN carding groups will have more impact than anything...
No site wants to loose top groups for shitty affils that just
violate the scene eh? Use your credibility and reputation for the
betterment of the scene. This is OUR scene people , if we don't care,
why should anyone else?

It is ultimately a risk to us all.

To ECN, is it really worth it... ?

peace and all things good to the scene..
