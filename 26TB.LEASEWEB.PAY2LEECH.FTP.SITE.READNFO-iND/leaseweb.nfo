26tb pay2leech site oh goodie just what u need to brighten your day!

check pictures, not much to talk about this 1 really i dont have alot of information
on the guy apart from this.

BNC 85.17.1.84:7321
checked passive connections from looks of it its all leaseweb including the BNC although
as shown in pic 2 you can see an ip leading to ohtele.com, not an expert so you decide

im guessing this is just a seperate ftp running privately away from the real ftp because
there is nothing showing that there are users on it, and usually sites do show up the 
normal stuff like that.

here is the what shows when you log in...
ya can see its runnin glftpd, all commands i could think of where restricted i could
not use any of them, also there is a request folder i could not request anything and
there was no usernames on the requests.
