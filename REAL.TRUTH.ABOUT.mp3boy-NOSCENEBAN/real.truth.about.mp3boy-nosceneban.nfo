Personal life is not the scene. We should not let differences in the real life inflict damage upon the ones we are in the scene. First of all I would like to say: I am not selling. This 4-year old picture is just a picture I made after I bought a lot of cdrs - ok, real convenient excuse right, but hey -  How is your word any better?


 
The people (I will use people, but the word I really ought to use is not proper to say in public) who say that I'm selling have got _NO_ evidence whatsoever, there is zero evidence in that nfo. The only thing in that nfo states that I've had a domain called racist.dk - thats my personal life - WHY DO YOU CARE? - and then you publish my real name and address.. WHY? What did that have to do with the case? Oh, I bought an IP-range - so what? Is that evidence that I'm selling? Another proof that your scene notice only was made to inflict damage, is the fact that you included a picture of me? What for? So siteops can run into me in real life and yell "deluser, deluser"?



And yeah, I got some scenereleated info on my website some years ago.. Still quite innocent informations though.




Wierd that in these days we judge people upon a notice with no evidence what so ever. People posting that kinda information, is to me, MUCH more a risk than the people they inflict damage upon. Judicial murder due to paranoia.




Hope your conscience is somewhat human and you will stand up, and admit your REAL intention with that scene notice. It sure wasn't for security purposes.
