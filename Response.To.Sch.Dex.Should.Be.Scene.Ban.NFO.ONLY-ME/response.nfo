I wanted to respond to the recent accusations (Schdex.should.be.scene.ban-iND), about me being as a security hole.

1. I never was and never will be connected with any public echoing/announcechans.
	- Vcdgermany <- whatever that is
2. Those who know me and worked with me know that.
3. I was (now have to realy think it over) running a professional prebot, not conencted with any public source (show me one fake in my DB).
4. I never forced anyone to use my prebot, siteops came to me, did the config on their own, and selected the functionality they wanted to use on their sites.

I'm in the middle of updates, and I already did some site droping few days ago, so my first guess is some siteop was not very happy about it :/
If you feel insecure in any way becouse of me, just say so, and I will not have to select the sites to drop myself :)

best regards

P.S. The info we all read just uncovers the tip of the iceberg, there are a lot of announcechans and prebots running, more or less public (as you might say). I will be more than happy to help find people who echo stuff in public and wipe their asses of the Earth. I already did that earlier, when several siteops asked me to do so.
P.P.S. Sorry, didn't have time to make some nice ascii :)
