Siteop: A1
A1 aka trebor, this guy has had sceneNFO's pred about him in the past, basically for selling leech and for 
supporting dcc+ and torrents.


siteop: IcZ
IcZ is well known for hanging with guys who have been found out to be leaking releases to p2p, a slave owner
from PIA provided us with some logs, which included this line.
( IcZ ) also if U or any of ur co payers are in /on torrents best to use a different irc nick then one that might be seen on a torrent site



The Reason I have done this is not because i have anything against this site, or its users, its the fact that 
its getting near summer now and busts are all around the corner and we all know it!, do we really want to have affils
on our sites that affils sites like PIA??. This is not what the scene was made for, the siteops are making profit
via there reseller everytime somebody links a slave.

This site is just asking to be busted, if you are on this site get of it asap, its a major security breach.

I will continue to pay leech at this site, and give you updates in the current week, until then!
