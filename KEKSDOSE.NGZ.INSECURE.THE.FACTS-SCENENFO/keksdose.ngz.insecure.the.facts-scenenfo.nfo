Well here i am again...

As some of u have noticed KEKSDOSE 200Mbit .de NGZ is still alive!Damn what a mess!

But i think one week was long enough to get off from this crappy shit!

[R] 250-  |  NeW AFFiL  : We are proud to present p0rn4u as new AFFiL ............  |

Well nice Affils...what about an SCENE BAN 4 them??? I mean just some months ago German GVU busted some NGZ sites!

How can i Affil a Site which is such kinda unsecure...
and i think GVU will come back to NGZ in some days i just need to read topic of #Keksdose in EfNET:

* Topic is 'Possible temp. Takedown of Site cause of Security Reasons,stay tuned ท'
* Set by _Pille!tpt@bastard-operator.****.*****.de on Tue Dec 14 13:12:52

well i wonder why pille knows to take down site...i will tell you...
maybe he allready received a message that all servers will get proved by GVU in some Time? He could know it cause he is NGZ-ADMIN!!!  

WHO KNOWS what will happen...i dont care!!!! But what i know is that such insecurenes shouldn't be in scene any more!

Well i made a Couple of Screenshots for all secure sites which dont want such crap-users/afills!!!

SITEOPS CHECK YOUR USERDB/AFFILS AND GET THOSE KEKSDOSE LAM3RS THE HELL PURGED FROM UR SITE!!!!

Like i told u all Users of KEKSDOSE also included and just look who is idlin in their chan!


KEEP THE SCENE CLEAN AND DON'T SUPPORT NGZ SITES ANY LONGER!!!! SPREAD IT!!!
