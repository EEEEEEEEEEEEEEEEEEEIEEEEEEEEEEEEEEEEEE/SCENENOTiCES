Scene Statement - 05/25/2004



Fellow scene members sadly it would appear NovaVCD has an unfounded 
and badly misinformed enemy within the scene.

A console release group is spreading malicious and unsupported rumours 
that NovaVCD are selling leech slots for financial gain. For obvious 
security concerns and for the longevity of the scene NovaVCD would 
like to state that we DO NOT sell leech slots.

I could not understand where and why this type of rumour evolved. 
Several of our Affil sites asked if there was any truth to this 
allegation, at that time I asked those siteops to monitor our leech 
accounts and check all historical usage. Not one complaint has ever 
been made regarding the usage (in fact totally the opposite, we was 
praised for never abusing any of our accounts) of not only our leech 
accounts but also team memberís accounts. Our loyal affil sites have 
stuck with us and even previously affiliated sites have requested our 
return. 

The following information is offered to the scene as proof that NovaVCD 
does not participate in the support of private FTP sites or the selling 
leech slots.

The rumours began just prior to the recent scene busts (a worrying time 
for all). The console group in question had us removed from a site by 
stating that they (console group) would not affil on the same site as us. 
I spoke with a member of the console group (as it transpires this person 
is someone I once met at a gathering of some well respected scene members 
sometime ago). This is when he told me the console group he was apart of 
was making allegations that NovaVCD was selling leech slots. I asked the 
member to provide proof of this allegation however he could not provide 
any (because there was none). Things went very quiet, until recently when 
yes you got it we lost another affil site for the very same reason as the 
previous one. So I decided to do a little investigation work myself.

Firstly I feel it relevant to provide a little NovaVCD history. 
Approx. 12 months ago I was the main ripper for NovaVCD when the gadmins 
at that time informed me NovaVCD was going to close for a number of reasons 
(mainly due to real life commitments). I asked if I could take over and 
continue to provide quality releases in much the same way as was being done 
at that time, which eventually I did. Since then NovaVCD has been 
rationalised to a very small number of close personal friends, and not the 
12 member team it used to be.

The issue appears to be, there is a forum which is dedicated to the 
buying/selling/trading of warez on various forms of media (CDR/DVDR etc). 
The same forum expanded over a period of time to also include the sales 
of FTP leech accounts. Approx. 12 months ago, the main FTP player on the 
forum was a site and user called MB. MB offered monthly leech accounts for 
a fixed subscription fee.

Members of the forum saw the monetary success MB was achieving and decided 
to also make financial gains from this idea. Understandable the availability 
of ìpay for accessî sites grew and competition grew at a substantial rate 
also for MB. The forum members now had a choice of numerous sites to choose 
from. MB began to lose many of his paying customers to his competitorís sites.

I was informed that allegedly one of MB's ìpay for accessî competitor sites 
was initially started by an ex-NovaVCD member(s). A member of the console 
group found out that an ex-NovaVCD member(s) were involved in running the 
rival site he (console group member) was supporting/running and making 
financial gains from. Mistakenly the console group member wrongly assumed 
that the member(s) still had an association with NovaVCD. The assumption 
made by the console group member was inaccurate; the ex-NovaVCD member(s) 
have had no affiliation or contact with NovaVCD since they left some several 
months. I did manage to confirmed that this was the case but those ex-member(s) 
who were initially involved in MB rival site decided that the risks where 
too great and they got out a short time after they initially got involved.

MB, the biggest site 12 months ago is now struggling to maintain its ìpay 
for accessî members. MB is currently and has always been managed in the 
capacity of a siteop by a member of the console group making these false 
allegations. I have text proof from members of MB showing just WHO the siteop 
is, and have been sent jpegs of the site.

MB and the console group would love to see nothing more than NovaVCD dead 
within the scene. They believe NovaVCD owns one of the many competitor sites 
or supplies warez which are made available to the ìpay for accessî accounts. 
By spreading these malicious rumours they hope to decrease our affiliations 
thus reducing the supply of warez to the pay for access accounts (sadly for 
you that is just not going to work guys because we have no relationship with 
these types of sites). With a reduced supply of warez MB and the console group 
hope to recover some of the pay for access accounts that will leave the 
numerous competitor sites. 

MB and the console group member(s) are clever in their planning and execution 
of these rumours given the current and welcomed tightening of site security. 
Ironically their plan is based on incorrect and unsupported information. 
NovaVCD has nothing at all to do with the selling of leech slots on forums 
or by any other means. The console group on the other hand does have a long 
established relationship with MB and can/should be considered to sell
ìpay for accessî accounts.

The last thing NovaVCD wants is a war with ANY group, thatís why the console 
group making these false allegations has not been named throughout this document. 
We are not in the game of name and shame however if pushed I am sure once 
people see the text conversations I have and supporting jpegs, they will soon 
learn who is at fault here and itís not NovaVCD.

We hope you will still continue to enjoy our quality releases and please rest 
assured we do not participate in the practices which MB and the console group 
partakes in.

Thanks for taking the time to read the above and letís hope this puts a stop 
to all these silly rumours and games being played. The scene has too many 
enemies as it is without fellow groups attempting to damage one another.

NovaVCD
