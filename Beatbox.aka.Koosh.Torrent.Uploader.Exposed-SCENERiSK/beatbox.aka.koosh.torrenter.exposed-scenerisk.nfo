Greetings fellow sceners

I have put this scene notice out because of a torrent uploader that goes by the name of Beatbox (and also Koosh)
Koosh (his torrent name) goes by the nick: Beatbox

> Nick: E~Beatbox
> Address: ~bill.gate@host86-132-194-9.range86-132.btcentralplus.com «Internic Commercial»
> Name: Beatbox
> Channels: #E~#<channel we were in>
> Server: efnet.teleglobe.net, Artes, scientia, veritas

he may be on other irc servers.

there following is a log from irc when he cam in a channel i was in and started blabbering about some torrent sites he was uploading to...

[2:33am] <E~Beatbox> y0 <me>... check this for a pre (3m, 16s after pre.)
[2:33am] <E~Beatbox> for a DVDR
[2:33am] <E~Beatbox> not bad?
[2:33am] <E~Beatbox> gbit box is flying ;p
[2:34am] <E~Beatbox> you should realy torrent yourself... i don't see why people don't... its just as fast as fxp.
[2:34am] <E~Beatbox> sometimes you can pull more, plus with torrents its just not the case of fxp.. Bang done.
[2:34am] <E~Beatbox> you get to have more fun with torrents ;)
[2:34am] <me> dude thats not right
[2:34am] <me> ppl in here prolly dont like what they are reading
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> Common
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> sure they will
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> they can all go for it
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> i recommend FTN.
[2:35am] <me> ftn?
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> or ScT... but sct staff are a bunch of fucking asswips =)
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> FeedTheNet
[2:35am] <me> i see
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> ;)
[2:35am] <me> goodbye
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> right.
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> Peace.
[2:35am] <E~Beatbox> Koosh 4EVER!

and then finally left the channel. I don't know why he is still under the same nick but this goes to show how stupid torrenters can be.

im not positive but im pretty sure Koosh is either his torrent nick or something related to him like that

He's obviously in or knows ftn and sct... and most probably in other torrent sites.

so please siteops if you know any users on your sites by the login or nick of beatbox or koosh please beware and check them out.
