20:16 2005-03-14 - The story about the losers

The heroes iND has made it again. Preing shit that no one
cares about and is proud of it. They telling us alot of
things like "TFT" isnt a loved group, and that we won't miss
them. They is probleby the most loved swedish group on the
scene. And prob. they just cant take that TFT wanted to tell
us about the scene security, cause they know about it.

So lets se what quality releases the guys from iND makes
that makes them a more trustable group than TFT. Have a
look:

Antipiratbyran.com.Hacked.WebRip-iND                        <-- Freeware!?
Rougie.The.Narqer.READ-NFO-iND                              <-- Crap/Fake
MaddoxX.Is.Making.SCENE.UNSECURE.READNFO-iND                <-- Crap
Rapport.About.Bahnhof.Bust.CUSTOM.ENGSUB.READ.NFO-iND       <-- Custom CRAP on a TV!
Dont_Spread_Fake_Scene_Notice-TXT-2005-iND                  <-- ?
... And much more NUKED crap!

Now goto your fav. dupebot and dupe for -TFT

You will soon know who the heroes is, and who is the bad guys
in this story. This is a warning guys, if you countinue like
this we will start nuke the few quality releases you got, and
belive me, I'm not alone.

By the way, I wan to greet all guys in
The Force Team Movie sections. We will miss you guys, and I hope
you will make a comeback when you understand, like the rest of us
on the scene that we cant make it without you.

Also a note to all siteops. Dont think about taking down your sites,
thats will make the scene die, just see this as a warning.
Maybe you can make the security better. Together we will make the
scene more secure then ever!
