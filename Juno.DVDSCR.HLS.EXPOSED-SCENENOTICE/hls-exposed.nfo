Juno.DVDSCR-SCENENOTICE was allready out but it didnt gave much information, so we would like to add some more info to get things straight.

well well, the "mighty" HLS did it again.
Last time you raped Mr Magorium TC of your favorite supply site www.interfilm.ru and now this...
Now you guys come up with this Juno dvdscreener.
The amazing thing is that this time it wasnt on interfilm :D
But..this morning there were some rumours going on about that a near perfect copy of Juno was leaked on p2p/www

After some searching this we found some intresting links which directed us to the source of it.

As you can see on these links, the copy was added a day and on some places 10-12 hours ago.

So yeah, does this shit needs any more information?
Anyone can download that crap, run it through your encoders, decoders, transcoders and
pop out a legit 'scene' version... its not hard, and you think your the only group that
actually found the release and noone else in the scene or on p2p knows about it?
We knew some group would do it, and HLS was assumed.. he aims, he shoots, he scores....
and they nuke and discrace... finally... after many stolen movies from p2p, finally the
gig is up... well we hope anyway. 
I would like to point you to the fact that the scene is full of retarded fags like HLS,
but im not gonna waste my time mentioning them all. 
All I say is that there are many grps out there doing the exact same thing.

We would like people to take the proper actions against groups like HLS.
And a final note to HLS : Why dont you come up with some proof that the source is yours, as in a photo
of the actual dvd that it was ripped from with a lil note sitting next to it with 'HLS'
written on it? enough said. its getting sad isnt it? sad days call for sad measures...
now wheres the tissues so we can all have a bitch and a cry.
