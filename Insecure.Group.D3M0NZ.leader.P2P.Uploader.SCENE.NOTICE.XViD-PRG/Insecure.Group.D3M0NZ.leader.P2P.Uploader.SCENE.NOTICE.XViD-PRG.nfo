///////////////////
//////////////////

groupadmin of d3m0nz is _R4Z0R_ aka _BL4DE_ aka r4z0r aka Steve20
ex member of OPTiC and maybe ALLiANCE and P2P uploader

Lets get some facts first:
He does not care about nukes and "fights against P2P groups" in his NFOs <- lol joke of the year
examples?

The.Men.Who.Stare.At.Goats.2009.R5.LINE.XviD-D3M0NZ:


 * A BIG FAT UPDATE on P2P GROUPS, sops nuke, delete, purge, fuck on spot: 
   nDn, DOMiNO, LAP, xSCR, xR5, FiCODVDR, FOXNEWS, MJ2009, LUMiX, DELETHiS
   ZETA, BoNkErS, STOLENTORRENT and all other pathetic retards out there 
   trying to pass p2p encodes on scene, go fuck yourselves and die, kkthx.
   

 * Special note yet again to infamous nDn p2p grp, u sure need a lot of nfos
   just to prove how deep in p2p shit u're, using p2p silvers doesnt make
   it any less being a p2p gaylord, who you're for sure, those 5 years in sce-
   ne, i loled, fucker u have no clue whatsoever about us, please just die,
   we thank in advance, and wont ever waste time responding to your retarded
   ascii nfo messages from now on, /me spits out @ nDn and gets some food.
   ...and every time i see nDn preing i lol on carpet...
                                -ask your local siteop-
                                
So, lets see who has P2P connections:
nDn - maybe
DOMiNO - not likely
LAP - could be
xSCR - P2P- some stolen sources
xR5 - see xSCR
FiCODVDR - you are kidding right?
MJ2009 - P2P
LUMiX - who the fuck is that
DELETHiS - maybe
ZETA - who the fuck is that
Bonkers - maybe
STOLENTORRENT - oh come on look at the fucking name you dumbass
(and no i am NOT member of any group named above)

'using p2p silvers doesnt make it any less being a p2p gaylord':
so what did you use here?

Alvin.and.the.Chipmunks.The.Squeakquel.2009.READNFO.TELESYNC.XviD-D3M0NZ
^^^^^^ silver source

The.Princess.and.the.Frog.TELESYNC.XViD-D3M0NZ
^^^^^^ P2P/Silver source AOE used it before - you did not even ask for permission

Sherlock.Holmes.2009.TELESYNC.XviD-D3M0NZ
^^^^^^ most likely p2p source it was sold on streets in .ru and .ua

The.Men.Who.Stare.At.Goats.2009.R5.LINE.XviD-D3M0NZ
^^^^^^ well see below....


Daybreakers.2009.PROPER.TELECINE.READNFO.XviD-D3M0NZ
^^^^P2P source used as there is only one source from 'ELEKTRI4KA'

from a secure source i know that they had NO AUDIO for that rls
then razor magically showed up with an MP3...
syncer synced it and denoised all that crap
but it goes still out of sync on 1h23min (THX for P2P Group Xr5 for noticing that you are at least usefull for something :))
as the P2P release, so audio is clearly stolen.
also need to note here that d3m0nz is NOT MENTiON (nor is razor).


now lets get some proof for his p2p activity:
first we need his hometracker: Torrentleech.org
normally TL does not win any XViD 'races', now lets see the D3M0NZ statistics for TL:

1. [ TL ] [ #1 ] [ Sherlock.Holmes.2009.REPACK.TELESYNC.XviD-D3M0NZ ] [ 8m 19s After Pre ]

2. [ TL ] [ #2 ] [ Sherlock.Holmes.2009.TELESYNC.XviD-D3M0NZ ] [ 58s After Pre ]

TL is clearly faster than normal lets see a normal xvid race of TL:
   [ TL ] [ #5 ] [ Fish.Tank.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-ALLiANCE ] [ 6m 43s After Pre ]

   
lets see who the fuck upped them to the tracker:
---> steve20

lets see linknet:
_R4Z0R_ is "RAZOR"
_R4Z0R_ is blade203@89.248.256.256
_R4Z0R_ using link-net.org, [LinkNet IRC Network]
Raw: _R4Z0R_ is an SSL Encrypted Client
----> linknet.jpg / http://i48.tinypic.com/1045cuw.jpg

and thanks to someone at linknet (you know who you are!) i know that he uses his box as proxy there.

his servers IP is     89.248.168.164
his linknet hidden IP 89.248.256.256
you must be dumb to use ecatel at all but even dumber to use your scene box as SEEDBOX on
torrent!!!

proof?
sure
for that we download a torrent he uploaded on TL as first 
so he is the only user with 100% of it and only seeder and see his IP
----->proof_torrent.jpg / http://i50.tinypic.com/zjxb3b.jpg
----->proof_torrent2.jpg / http://i45.tinypic.com/2hyj86r.jpg

See his IP in this screenshot and that he uploaded it in the second!
enough proof IMO.

And now also look at his TL profile LOL:
-----> profile_tl.jpg / http://i46.tinypic.com/29cx7df.jpg

he asks for SUPPLIERS on P2P and GREETS P2P Groups - LOL
dont forget to spam steve5@post.sk




for now i will not include any sitenames or something, but that could happen.
and to the nukenets: stop delpreing this notices as spam as you can clearly see 
they are no pre spam
 there is NFO and pictures even right packed as 0day so stop it please unlike steve20 aka r4z0r i respect your work.
