To The Lame OPERATiONSCT..

First of all, All these nfo's you are releasing is only advertising for these sites. Stop revealing the web addresses.
and unless you are sure a site is involved in sct uploads then do not releases their site name in a nfo you fucking morons.

In perticular that .txt of site skiplist was sent to a dozen .us colo sites when it was created 2 weeks ago. Has nothing to actually
do with mlr or anyone on it accept the lame auto'rs.

Second the ip's you mentiond in your 3rd nfo are not on site logs anywhere. So your only assumtion that this site was involved
was because of a .txt file great so lets blast their name.

Leave the nfo's to people who actually know what they are doing and quit flooding the scene with your lame attempt to ban ppl.
Im done.


P.S. Be a good little bitch boy like your daddy made you when you were little.
