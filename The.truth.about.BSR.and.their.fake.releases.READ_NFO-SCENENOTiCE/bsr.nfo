lo folks, 
here we are with a a nice group called BSR, rlsing fakes... 
they actually could have had a little more careful with those, who would have line sources in ALL events/disco's/partys afterall ? ;) 

here some examples: 
 
Alexander_Kowalski_Live_at_Monegros_Desert_Festival-23-07-2005-LiNE-BSR 
is the same set as 
Alexander_Kowalski-Live_at_Monegros_Desert_Festival_(Radio3)-(READ_NFO)-07-23-DAB-2005-NYD 
only a few sec shorter 
 
The_Advent_Live_at_Ostfunk_Berlin-18-03-2006-LiNE-BSR 
is the same set as 
Tresor_Berlin_Closing_Party_-_The_Advent_Live_at_Tresor-04-04-LINE-2005-XDS 
only a few sec shorter 
 
Christian_Wuensch_Live_at_Tresor-14.04.2005-LiNE-BSR 
same set as 
Tresor_Berlin_Closing_Party_-_Christian_Wuensch_Live_at_Tresor-04-14-LINE-2005-XDS 
but shorter, dupe anyways 
 
Irie_Electric_Live_at_Globus-15-04-2005-LiNE-BSR 
awful quality, cant be line, we would say a stream

Jay_Denham_Live_at_Summer_Spirit-27-08-2005-LiNE-BSR 
same as 
Tresor_Berlin_Closing_Party_-_Jay_Denham_Live_at_Tresor-04-07-LINE-2005-XDS 
 
Steve_Bicknell_Live_at_Summer_Spirit-27-08-2005-LiNE-BSR 
same as 
Tresor_Berlin_Closing_Party_-_Steve_Bicknell_Live_at_Tresor-04-07-LINE-2005-XDS


they're german, so they affil mostly in .DE sites.
BSR do us a favor, leave scene please, what a fucking plague.
siteops from sites who affil them, purge them :-)
for those who thinks this ain't enough, just dupecheck their releases and start comparing.

/ meh
