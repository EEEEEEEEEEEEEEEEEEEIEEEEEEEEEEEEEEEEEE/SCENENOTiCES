so here we fucking go again. time to lay something on the scene that has been needed to be said for some time.
because this time, kiddo, you've gone too far.

EVERYBODY knows the infamous r0bbie by now im sure. he is a tool. he's been lying to huge groups, you (the listeners)
and himself since day 1 of his arrival into our beloved scene.

Fuck off r0bbie.
or should i say,
Fuck off, ROBERTO MEDINA RAMIREZ

01[19:33] <----> shit's not smart
[19:33] <pulsecode> lmao
[19:33] <pulsecode> in this other chan
[19:33] <pulsecode> right after he said that
[19:33] <pulsecode> hangon 
[19:33] <pulsecode> i quote
[19:34] <pulsecode> [16:32:08] <@pulsecode> i kind of suspect
[19:34] <pulsecode> [16:32:11] <@pulsecode> that robbie
[19:34] <pulsecode> [16:32:18] <@pulsecode> has something to do with ApoLLo
01[19:34] <----> LOL
[19:34] <pulsecode> [16:35:01] <@pulsecode> because of his constant use of the phrase 'multiplayer notepad', the way he defended the ApoLLo release, and Apollos affinity for their begiinnings around last month and Coheed, which he was feverishly trying to get information about/on
[19:34] <pulsecode> and then he sent me that image
[19:34] <pulsecode> i was like .. d00d


lol...

Forget Regret
Someone hook it up with a leak.it invite.
I'm curious about it.
Email: glaciersandisles@gmail.com
I've got 0-sec access and would be able to post scene pres within minutes.
Also about 500GB of scene MP3 to share.
If you're looking for new leaks and have got nowhere to go, check out the irc channel
#thescene-albums on irc.noideairc.net
Great for new music leaks.
type "/s -m irc.noideairc.net -j #thescene-albums" without the quotes in any window on mirc
to join the channel.

fuck.


ALL IM ASKING IS THAT YOU BAN ApoLLo FROM THE SCENE, FUCK r0bbie IN THE ASS, AND TEACH THEM A FUCKING LESSON.

included are some proofs in picture format just incase he tries to hide.

eventually they will do something that will get YOU in trouble.

so... lets clean up the scene, yeah?



PS: HUUUUGE thanks to the Undisclosed Sexy Informant for this.
