
First of all, sorry about the lengthy NFO. But rest assure, you don't want to miss this!

Well, what to say, what todo. There are IDIOTS everywhere, but this is the truth about one FUCKER in particular.


GeeMann

GeeMann is GeeMann@wnpgmb06dc1-166-105.dynamic.mts.net
Dns resolved wnpgmb06dc1-166-105.dynamic.mts.net to 206.45.166.105

Good racer, been with us for almost 4 years. Was on top most of the time, but jeez what a bad tempered, crazy, idiot fucker...
What did he do?
He did a major NO NO, posted our bnc's wide open in a public chan - FUCKER!!
Why he did it?
We nuked his sorry ass cuz of scene rules, and he just blew up.. omg, the idiot can't even take a single nuke?!
The man has been with us for fucking 4 years..!! And gives us hell for what?! A bloody nuke - legit aswell..
Actually he has done som more crazy things.. he added info about another ring in a predb, info saying the ring had been hacked.

I dont know about you guys, but if you have him @ your place, remove the fucker before he gives you trouble.
He should - in our opinion - be scene-banned!
Do whatever you like - its your risk.
We can only share - what the fucker did to us.

Over a nuke!!

Jeez!


Peace

Ps. GeeMann, if you see this, fuck you asshole! We took you in, gave you all the means to do a good job, let you stay
those months you had a hard time, and you pay back like this? Go fuck a donkey!

A few minutes later another siteop contacts him:
________________________________________________

[09:06:35] <siteop2> GeeMann
[09:06:37] <siteop2> fill me in
[09:06:38] <siteop2> sup man
[09:06:44] <GeeMann> this is BS
[09:06:55] <siteop2> sup man
[09:07:05] <GeeMann> ur nukers fucked me and siteop supported it  when rules dont say shit
[09:07:23] <GeeMann> siteop anted to go to wqar
[09:07:28] <GeeMann> war*
[09:07:48] <siteop2> Chill for a sec and explain it to me man
[09:07:59] <siteop2> So you got nuked for something, that siteop said was okay? and rules dont mention it at all
[09:08:09] <GeeMann> exactly
[09:08:25] <GeeMann> siteop didnt say it was ok
[09:08:32] <GeeMann> he said it was in rules
[09:08:43] <GeeMann> and it isnt
[09:08:45] <siteop2> ok
[09:08:49] <siteop2> so what was it you uploaded?
[09:08:50] <GeeMann> i asked then got kicked for it
[09:09:08] <GeeMann> somew FS csswesub
[09:09:17] <GeeMann> snakes on a plane i think
[09:10:07] <GeeMann> rules dont prohibit it   siteop says what sitew does
--[8<]--
[09:13:11] <GeeMann> I ask a q and no answer  but get kicked   fuck that
--[8<]--
[09:16:35] <siteop2> Ah man
[09:16:38] <siteop2> Well i see about the FS
[09:16:48] <siteop2> its a scene rule, Normaly site dont have all scene rules in there site rules inf
[09:17:01] <siteop2> It was not us that made up that rule, it was the community
[09:17:18] <GeeMann> then somesone shoudl have said soething
[09:17:38] <siteop2> Well, no one was awake i guess
[09:17:54] <GeeMann> maybe tech should update rules
[09:18:03] <GeeMann> either wqay damage is done
[09:18:14] <siteop2> It will not be in rule as long as its a scene standart, we follow other sites in that way ;(
--[8<]--
[09:18:29] <siteop2> del our sites form that lame dupedb
[09:19:09] <GeeMann> i can del them  but I need an appology from siteop after hew invites me back
[09:19:40] <siteop2> What do you expect man, you public our ips on a public dupe db...
[09:19:55] <siteop2> [07:59:36] <@siteop> > Fullscreen custom swesub is not allowed, period. It's not our site rules, it's "scene standard".
[09:20:00] <siteop2> That was his anwser to why it got nuked
[09:20:24] <GeeMann> he didnt answer  nor did nuker
--[8<]--
[09:20:45] <GeeMann> and if not in rules   do i have to be a mind reader
[09:20:47] <siteop2> but since it was a scene standard there would have been nothing to talk about really
[09:20:52] <siteop2> nope
[09:20:57] <siteop2> but you do follow scene rules with everything else right
[09:21:03] <siteop2> as in nuke for bad.itvc etc etc
[09:21:20] <GeeMann> yes  but it wasnt bad ivtc
[09:21:22] <siteop2> no
[09:21:24] <siteop2> it was fs
--[8<]--
[09:21:32] <GeeMann> it was simply a subjective nuke
--[8<]--
[09:22:28] <GeeMann> sorry u cant convince me   I have been on too many sites and never have I seen this
[09:23:02] <siteop2> Its not about convincing anyone
[09:23:08] <siteop2> its about What you just did man
[09:23:21] <siteop2> you public a sites ips on a public dupe db, how do you think other sites will do?
[09:23:56] <GeeMann> thats after the fact   dont try and twist it
[09:24:06] <siteop2> I am not twisting anything
[09:24:24] <siteop2> its one thing to disagree, its a hole other thing to damage a site and all its users
[09:24:48] <GeeMann> read the logs   I was being an ass   but only still asking q's
[09:24:52] <GeeMann> then get banned
[09:25:03] <siteop2> It clearly say in rules dont argu with nukers or siteops
[09:25:10] <siteop2> and after siteop told you we where only following scene rules
[09:25:14] <siteop2> then there was nothing left to talk about ;(
[09:25:41] <GeeMann> well I argue  when @ are wrong   most sites are reasonable and listen
[09:25:56] <siteop2> but we where not wrong
[09:26:24] <GeeMann> bottom line  is my user file going to be reinstated   or not
[09:27:03] <siteop2> after you giving info about out about our ring on public dupe dbs?
[09:27:20] <GeeMann> sorry i haveee to  work i the am to feed my kids and dont have time to bs
[09:28:08] <GeeMann> yes   ring will have to change bnc i guess
--[8<]--
[09:28:24] <siteop2> you gave our ips
[09:28:26] <siteop2> we will have to shutdown
[09:28:53] <GeeMann> i still dont have an answer
[09:32:49] <GeeMann> screw it  I will post the rest, I dont have time to fuck around]
[09:33:01] <GeeMann> nite
--[8<]--
[09:33:15] <siteop2> no way we can let you back after doing that
[09:33:17] <siteop2> but dont post the rest man
[09:33:18] <siteop2> this is insane
[09:33:28] <GeeMann> too late
--[8<]--
[09:33:51] <siteop2> We will see how this ende up for both of us then
[09:34:23] <GeeMann> prob not topo good  but sitep should have thought of that
--[8<]--
[09:35:16] <GeeMann> Canada dont have laws yet   I am clear
[09:35:25] <siteop2> i am not talking about your real life
[09:35:28] <siteop2> more about your scene life
[09:36:08] <GeeMann> after I let it oput about siteop and xxx-xxxxxx  who do u think will hurt more
[09:37:30] <siteop2> not sure i follow
[09:37:48] <GeeMann> well we will call it a test then
--[8<]--
[09:40:45] <GeeMann> siteop better worry about changing his nick'
--[8<]--
[09:43:48] <GeeMann> if no changes b am  I will do what I have 6to do
