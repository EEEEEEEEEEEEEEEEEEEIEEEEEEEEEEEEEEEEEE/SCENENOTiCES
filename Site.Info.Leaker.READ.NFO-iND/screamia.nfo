Here it happens again. I guess no one learned anything from sites.rar.

Info of this sites: SMP , SOE , UMP , TUC , SWW , TSA was leaked.

Channel nick list and bnc's.

His username: ScreaM
IRC nick: ScreaM_ 
IRC Linknet host: ~ScreaM@LinkNet-b7ebb00853.vanderbilt.edu
Group he was on a site we caught him: MiA
And ofcourse, hes .il, like the owner/creator of sites.rar.

Heres example:

Well some unrelated info: those addline stealer still around, they tried to get one from one of my friends. 

Some new rules:

1. No, when someone just pm you to add you to his leet gigabit.nl or something like that, he just want your addline.
usually they even say that they got your nick from site, probably one of those if you're there, and thats what makes some of us weak and we give addlines.

* If they pmed someone with a site name that not on this list, probably theres a leaker of info on that site, so pm siteop.

2. dont use same password in addlines. 
first of all use temp password and change it in first login.
second, use diffrent password for each site. and just back up your sites.dat file with one password you know, and save it on some secure place, like cdrw/trusted network place.

3. stop trying to be on as much sites as possiable. no, its not leet, its just not secure. be on places you trust!

4. siteops need to check twice before adding any .il people. theres good ones, but some of them is fxpboarders and leaking info, hacking sites, and such. better add the trusted ones. not easy but worth trying.


well, thats all for now.
