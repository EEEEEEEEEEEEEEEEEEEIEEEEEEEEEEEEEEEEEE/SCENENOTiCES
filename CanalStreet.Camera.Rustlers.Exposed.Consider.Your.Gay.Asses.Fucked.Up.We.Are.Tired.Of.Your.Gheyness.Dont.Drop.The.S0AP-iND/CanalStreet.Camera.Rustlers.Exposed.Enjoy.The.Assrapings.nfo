CanalStreet/Camera/Rustlers....

We are sick of your games. So.. Here is the truth for everyone to read about your gheyness.

The above mentioned groups have been getting all of their releases from p2p networks, torrents to be exact.

We released a notice on a few scene/torrent sites with some of canals ips exposed. 

The last ranges of their ips were blurred out in our previous notices due to the fact we werent really looking to get gay az busted.

You continue to be a pain in the rump on the scene as well as on torrents.

So consider yourselves now exposed.

Now for their personal information. This information was gathered from the abovenamed groups favorite torrent site.
They mentioned its name in one of their previous gay notices. Please refer there for the full url.

Now that we have exposed all that shit...
lets expose a little more...

Mooby from CanalStreet is the same person as Boothead aka Bootstrap from Camera and rustlers.
Mooby is also boothead and motex from the above mentioned torrent site.
They are all 1 and the same.

So basically they admit in their own nfo and notices that they steal from p2p.
And they have just been exposed as stealing releases from p2p.

What happened to the days when you would be seen banned for even being found on p2p networks?
These dumbasses have been confirmed time and time again to be getting their releases off p2p.

In case you didnt notice the pre tonight of
The.Simpsons.Movie.CAM.VCD-THS

THS = P2P group.
This release was pred by CanalStreet/Camera/Rustlers.

Basically means you guys have yet to ban/sceneban these pricks.

Siteops do yourselves a favor. Ban/Purge any Canalstreet/Camera/Rustlers members.
Having these assclowns on your site is a major security risk.
If you had them pre on your sites... I would recommend doing your thing to protect yourselves due to the fact they are being exposed 
and are not afraid to take you down with them.

These guys (Camera/CanalStreet/Rustlers) intentionally leaked the site information about NDT and the NDT Siteops 
info in their notice and claimed they were leaving the scene due to the fact Melvinmeow leaked that information. 
That notice pred by CanalStreet was a sack of shit... NDT was not exposed until CanalStreet themselves exposed it. 
More or less because they knew  a scene ban was finally coming for them, so they figured they would try and take a few down with them.


Now onto new news... Obviously some of you siteops out there have yet to ban these assclowns... not sure what your waiting on. 
Having these assclowns on your sites still is leaving yourself and your scene friends at risk. 
They blatantly seem to have no issue exposing anyone/everyone as you can see with the NDT incidents. 
WHEN they get busted... whats the first thing they are going to do?  EXPOSE YOU!!!

These Faggots have been playing their games long enough. Canalstreet/Camera/Rustlers... 
Consider your ghey asses officially exposed. I finally decided to not play games and wait for you to suddenly find information about me. 
You exposed NDT and you obviously wont stop there.. good riddens.

P.S. Try not to drop the soap when your in the prisonroom showers. Chances are some dude named Bubba is waiting for you to do this, 
so he can give you a nice boner up your bumhole. Least now youll have a smile on your face cause youll have the nice dick youve 
been waiting for cocksuckers.
