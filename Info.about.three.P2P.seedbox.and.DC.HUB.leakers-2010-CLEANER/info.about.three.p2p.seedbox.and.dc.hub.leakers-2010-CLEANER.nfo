Info.about.three.P2P.seedbox.and.DC.HUB.leakers-2010-CLEANER

Hello again :(
Omg. We just never imagine that we will pred next notice in next couple of hours.
What we found now is scene leak. Three guys are leaking scene releases to p2p (seedboxes)
and also to fuckin DC Hub. We cant believe in that but its true :( This time .jpg`s are not
included because what we get is user informations from one of the sites where the leak was
found.

[88.153.88.240 asteex/FRiENDS]   - << PORT 85.17.232.204 - DC++ Hub
[91.121.141.159 uman38/FRiENDS]   - << PORT 91.121.141.159 - Seedbox
[78.32.178.75 jon26/FRiENDS]   - << PORT 91.121.103.158 - Seedbox

Like we can see this info comes from one of the sites doesnt matter which one (but
just check ur sites and leave this one :))
asteex (IP: 88.153.88.240) was sending releases from this site to 85.17.232.204 (DC++ Hub).
uman38 (IP: 91.121.141.159) was added with rented ovh ip :( and he was sending releases
to his seedbox at OVH.
And the last of our "big three" jon26 (IP: 78.32.178.75) was sending releases to Seedbox 91.121.103.158.

If u have someone from this list u know what to do :P
