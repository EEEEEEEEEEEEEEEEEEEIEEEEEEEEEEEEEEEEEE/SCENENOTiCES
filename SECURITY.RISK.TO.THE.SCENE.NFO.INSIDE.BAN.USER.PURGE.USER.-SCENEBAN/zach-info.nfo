WE SUGGEST/INSIST YOU DELETE HIM AND PURFGE HIM NOT ONLY FOR BEING A NARC ON THE DDOS KIDS ON BLUEHELL BUT ALSO ADDMITTING TO NARCING TO THE FBI ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THEIR #BOTTALK CHANNEL.
ANY SITE OR TORRENT SITE THAT TAKES NO ACTIONS HAD BETTER PREPARE FOR US TO RELEASE SCENE NAMES OF YOUR UPLOADERS MR AND MRS TORRENT SITES OWNER.
NOW HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THE SCENE SITE OWNERS YOUR RACERS ARE ON ARE GONNA ACT WHEN THEY LEARN THEY ARE SUPPLYING TORRENT...
I WONT SAY BECAUSE YOU TORRENT OWNERS KNOW AS WELL AS I DO WHAT WE AT SCENEHQ WOULD DO AND WHAT THE SITE OWNER WOULD FO.
