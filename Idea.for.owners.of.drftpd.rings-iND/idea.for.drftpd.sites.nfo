Hey I'm a site owner and I had an idea that might make racing
between sites much faster.

This is how drftpd used to behave, prior to version 2.0, and I'm not
not sure if its a good idea or not but it doesn't seem to have any
downsides, I may just not be seeing something.

It makes the ftp server report the file as 0 bytes until it has been
completed.  This way the racers will skip the file until it is complete,
and then it will be raceable.  Often you might find yourself waiting
until one racer racing at a very slow speed finishes a file, which bottlenecks
the entire chain (a file is being transfered as its being uploaded, slowing
the speed of the file to whoever is transferring it initially).  Doing this
will remove that bottleneck and every file should be raced at full speed,
or at least your site won't slow down other sites.

This can't be accomplished if just one site does it, it has to be a very
large number of sites (as many as possible).  This cannot be accomplished
client side.  If you can think of any reason not to do this please e-mail me.

Thank you.


HOWTO:
in the file:
/src/net/sf/drftpd/master/command/plugins/DataConnectionHandler.java

comment out the line that reads:
_transferFile.setLength(status.getTransfered());

to comment, add a # before the line, so it looks like this:
#_transferFile.setLength(status.getTransfered());

It's before line 1273 (svn 1414): if (status.isFinished()) {

Then recompile with ant and restart your master.
I've done this on my site without issue.

There's no real point to making a diff patch because this is so simple
