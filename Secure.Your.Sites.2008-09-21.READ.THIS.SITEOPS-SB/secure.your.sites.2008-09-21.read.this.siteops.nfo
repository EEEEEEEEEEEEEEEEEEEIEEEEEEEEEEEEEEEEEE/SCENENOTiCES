more and more unsecure traders/siteops/users flooding our beloved scene

its up to the real-siteops to get the scene more secure by:
 - banning freaky traffic 
 - controlling the users AND traders

If you dont know, WHAT to ban, our little "scanjet" might be something for you.
its a graphical shell-friendly frontend (using dialog (curses)) to analyze
your sysop.log

Easy check, where your current onliners transfer files to and from. 
Scanjet displays: upload/download - remote IP - remote ISP country - remote ISP
You can scan the other site for open ports, torrents ports or whatever.
Its also possible to make a traceroute. More details are described 
within scanjet. (perhaps doesnt run under all *nix systems, but should
do under suse/debian....) 

PLEASE REMEMBER! YOUR server-IP is also logged on the other sites, where
your users transfer from or to! Might be a good idea **not** to have your IP
in logs of rented servers or russian mp3 selling platforms. *wink*

-> scanjet3.2.sh = 	original version
-> scanjet3.3.sh = 	3rd party modified version (using glftpds stats binary instead sitewho)

-> rangecheck1.sh = 	will analyze your sysop.log to check if there are transfer to or from
		    	known unsecure site locations - this script will show you the reality 

got some ideas? drop us a line: byterz@hush.com
