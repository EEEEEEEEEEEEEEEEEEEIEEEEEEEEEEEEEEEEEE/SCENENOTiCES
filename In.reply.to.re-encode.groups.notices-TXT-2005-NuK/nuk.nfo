First of all i would like to start by saying i agree these re-encoding groups should be stopped.. However, before i proceed to that I would like to point out that what the poster of the above mentioned notice has done is far worse than what these groups will ever do.. He has leaked information publically and he thinks he has the right to do it.

I personally have the power to nuke all these re-encoded releases -- it appears the poster of that notice does not, so he thinks that by leaking loads of information he is so fucking smart.. You are not, retard.

I would like to assure the groups that these re-encoding morons (including stolen video source for ts/tc with foreign synched audio) will begin to be nuked (and i have already started taking action these past 2-3 days) (Check out some of the star wars 3 workprint/tc nukes :).. I would like to ask for fellow nukers to follow similar action.

I would also like to take the time to ask the re-encoding groups to stop releasing their re-encoded or stolen source crap -- and i would like to ask for the siteops to disallow re-encoded releases on their sites (and de-affil any re-encode groups they have).

While reading that heap of crap that had the right idea in mind but broke several rules... i read a snippet that said was in a saosin nfo saying saosin would watermark their releases.. I understand they must be quite mad people steal their sources, but please do not watermark your releases as it is forbidden and you _WILL_ be nuked... rules apply to everyone.
