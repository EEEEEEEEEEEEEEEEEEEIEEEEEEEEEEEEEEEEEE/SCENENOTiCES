Multiple.Groups.Involved.With.P2P.SCENE.NOTICE-iND

Here is a hack from me to you, 
it goes like this and the story is true
first of all we have to say, 
we started to hack yesterday
my mom got sick and my dog went away 
but as you see down below, 
here is all the info you have to know.

Well, that's the fun part, now to something completely different.

As Geeks didn't go away even busted before, we'd continued hacking where others left of. 
First for kicks, later it got more serious as we where stunded by facts and the absurdity regarding Razin and safety. 
This bust is so massive and complex it's hard to explain.

Razin is deeper into p2p than you guys ever imagined.

We went after the n00b Razin and Geeks only, but found much much disturbing more..

This is not out of thin air, you will se proof of:

Razin is working together with ppl from DC++, furthermore supplying DC++ with scene releases.

Razin cooporating with various torrent guys

Razin is atm in Geeks - Brunox - DeLuX - Veyron - NONAME - Bountyhunters - RaDiuS.

He was indeed the owner of usenet nzb site www.fokus-online.net as stated in the last bust, proof included (Thanks guys).

You will see Razin recive subs to his NONAME grp directly from a torrent user called elyzzez.

Razin having axx to more than 1 p2p ftp. He is @ at 1, belive it or not. These ftps is so insecure, SSL yes, secure no.. 
Hell, we didn't even try to hack the server, the n00b gave the logins away. (Don't bother Razin, the logs wont say, we proxied our way in).

He is participating as user: Wroooom on a usenet nzb site called www.freshmoving.com , site located here: www.freshmoving.com/rats_keep_running_away/ 
We have also reason to belive he is currently active on another usenet nzb site called www.dff-online.net (no proff yet, but will keep on digging)

He is now working with Bountyhunters, he knows ReDeYe from Bountyhunters/Radius very well. 
Bountyhunters know who he is and also did a proper of 1 of Razins rls: They.Wait.2007.STV.PROPER.NORDiC.PAL.DVDR-BountyHunters

We have hacked his Skype and curently following every little step he takes. he is such a big n00b using insecure Skype instead of mIRC. 
Infact we are monitoring Razin this very moment. That includes Razins 'friends'. Every contact, every IP. Proof included.

Did we mention that we monitoring Razins Gmail, FTP access and P2P boardaxx as well?

Razin is doing a lot of talking with a guy called dvd_dude. After som research we discovered that dvd_dude is the same person as hk_dk (scene chan nick), 
he's equally active on p2p nzb site www.freshmoving.com. How can we be so sure? Well if you write with another skype user, the right tools will reveile other users ip addresses. 
See attached ip logs. All siteops knows we are telling the truth. dvd_dude is deep into p2p too, see dvd_dude_01.jpg and dvd_dude_02.jpg

We downloaded a movie called Quarantine from there p2p ftp which is source used for Quarantine.2008.MULTiSUBS.PAL.DVDR-BountyHunters. 
Again we did not use own ip's, happy hunting Razin. We will proof to you that source is p2p. btw Razin, the source was ripped the right way, 
you destroyed it when you and your p2p grp pred that shit. Stripping out something in p2p source not needed to be stripped hmmmmmm. 
All credz goes out to who did make the p2p source. 



PPL OF THE SCENE, these ppl are very insecure and a risk to us all:

GOS whois bountyhunters - radius

ReDeYe whois bountyhunters - radius

Razin whois Geeks - Brunox - DeLuX - Veyron - NONAME - Bountyhunters - RaDiuS (don't have his scene nick yet)

hk_dk whois deep into p2p with his friend Razin.

Wild0ne p2p guy DVD piraten.



What we didn't find:

2 missing members from Geeks, Az0 and R4iD, but who cares.

Razin is probaly not in to Napster, but seems to be the only good thing to say.



Screenprints explained:

ip.txt: loads of hosts and ips to p2p members, some of em might be at the scene, so be careful. If anyone possess or find more info about ip's in question do purge em and make a scene notice.

p2p.rls.1 to 5 shows info about Quarantine. yes we shows scrn in dvd remake coz its more easy to understand if you dont know anything about a dvd.
if vob_blanker pgc_edit scrns is needed we will show em also

We have hacked an account at freshmoving in order to monitor dvd_dude and Wroooom's activity. The profile used is blured as we'll continue to monitor Razins and dvd_dude's p2p work as long as needed. 
Following scrns show p2p at its worst: dvd_dude_01, dvd_dude_02, Wroooom01, Wroooom02, Wroooom03, Wroooom04, Wroooom05, Wroooom06.

112: Big fun !!, here you see Razin trying to obtain a driving licence as busdriver. We wish him luck. After this bust he might consider driving a bus instead of making the scene insecure. 
     If we ever see this prick at the scene after this bust, we will start hacking sites and give away everything we find without any warning.


Big thanks to the ppl who hacked that nOOb the first time. The info they delivered made this hack much more easy to do.

Missing numbers and a shitload others scrns is intentional left out. Many scrns shows the same p2p crap and some is kept in case any of those p2p guys ever show up again.

Keep the scene safe !!!
