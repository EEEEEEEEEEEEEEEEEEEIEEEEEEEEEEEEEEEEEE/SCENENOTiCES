I've been watching this tracker for quite some time now.

They get dvds uploaded very fast after pre, but there was one rls that really got my attention:

The.Talented.Mr.Ripley.1999.iNT.WS.NTSC.DVDR-EXT
Posted 19 minutes and 51 seconds after pre

Under 20 minutes for a dvdr release? That can only mean one thing. The leaker has an account
right on the EXT presite. So, lets see if there are any other EXT releases on the tracker...

These two made me really worried. They could mean 3 things:

1.) EXT is a p2p group

2.) EXT's presite is directly linked to p2p

3.) The uploader has an account on the EXT presite

After some further investigation, I came to a conclusion that option 1 is out of the
question. EXT is an old and well respected DVDR group and existed long before this tracker
was even created.

Theres little chance that option 2 is true, since this tracker has most of the stuff
uploaded fast after pre (see screens) so theres no reason to blame the site.

That leaves us with option 3. The uploader has an account on atleast one of the presites,
and probably a gbit seedbox. I managed to get his ip (see screens). Its hard to tell if
this is his real ip (i hope hes not that dumb?) or the ip of his seedobx. But think for a
second. EXT for example does mostly iNTERNAL dvds, so the releases arent spread that much
so it should be preety easy to tell who downloaded the dvd.

Now, EXT siteops! Do your duty! Just check your sites transfer logs or check wich user
downloaded the whole 3 releases, and you have your man. Delpurge the motherfucker, and
make his ip public so the other siteops can do the same. Act now, and toghether we can
make the scene a bit more secure.

Am I evil? Well... A bit. So a little warning to other leakers: stop what you are doing.
You will eventually get caught. Sure, you probably have huge cock sucking abilities, and
will return to the scene in a while, but ask yourself this: Is it worth it? Is it worth
risking it all for some p2p lamers who probably dont even respect what you risk for them?


Greetings to all the real groups who work for the scene and for the scene only. Your work
is respected, keep it up. Im going to take this opportunity and wish my ex-girlfriend, who
I still love with all my heart, a happy birthday, which is on the 20th of this month. Have
a good one sweetheart, best of luck in all the decisions you make, and please, never forget
me. Again, I still love you. For those of you who know me, you know I'm talking about P****.
Yep sweety, you had a real pirate in your life ;)

Over and out. //SceneNiNjA
