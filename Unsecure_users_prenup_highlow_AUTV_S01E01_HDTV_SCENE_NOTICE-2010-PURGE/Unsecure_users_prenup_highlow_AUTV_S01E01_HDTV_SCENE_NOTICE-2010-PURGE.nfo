So here we are again with some not so good news.
Lots to say.

It seems AUTV loves p2p kids and the prenets/nukenets love to also.
now its time to expose them
here are some of there sites SPL ATS
now ATS used to be called egypt/ALH its third time being renamed
ATS is around 130tb's owner kingkong
ATS is hosted at worldstream
SPL is around 15tb


ATS @ATS FTPd: fxp.ats.tw:2121
ATS @ATS IRCd: irc.ats.tw:+6697

SPL @superluminal bnc > 15820302**:245** > up
we will not protect p2p sites sorry kingkong now go leave or if u rename site again we will be waiting to expose u again
but if the other sites keep them we may be forced to release the full ip:port

Here we have a user called prenup which he used to go by another nick on sheeps/nukecouncil net
So we decided to ask him and he comes right out and tells us wow. he also runs tinyNET
