your friends of PROCYON back again :x
so what we have for you well unleashed
did a nice fast release of reservoir dogs
but since this is a new version of securom 7
(7.26) you need pr0tstop and securomv1.2 stop.
our loader doesn't need pr0tstop and will work
on the new 7.26 securom version for reservoir dogs.
enjoy!

:- put our loader into the game folder load it and point it to the  ResDogs.exe of unleashed release
