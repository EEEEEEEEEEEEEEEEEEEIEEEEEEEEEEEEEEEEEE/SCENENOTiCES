While hunting down our weekly batch of p2p leakers, we stumbled upon a torrentsite
called TorrentLeech ( http://www.torrentleech.org ). Nothing special. Just another
lame pay2leech site, with more than 100k users. While looking over the uploads, we
noticed something.

Stranger.Than.Fiction.2006.REAL.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-OGTXViD

The release is fine, but there were a few extra files added to the upload (check
the pics) that cought our attention.

Extra files:

abortionsareforbabies-sceppwdm.nfo
ogt-stf-xvid-cd1.sfv

The racers at the site that was taken from, obviously fucked something up, and no
one noticed. Thats why we decided to investigate. After two weeks of asking around,
we got word that the files came from a .nl site called ESC. After some digging, we
concluded that the site is probably linked to the notice pred a while ago:

SceneAccess.org.Uploader.Leaking.Releases.To.Tracker.Fast.After.Pre.READNFO-SCENENOTiCE

Why? ESC and SceneAccess IPs almost match, plus we got information that TL is known
to steal uploads from other torrent sites, so they probably stole that one two. How
lame can you get? We will not expose any names, ips or affils from ESC, only a pic
that was supplied by our mole on the inside, which clearly shows you the files came
from there. However, we will check if the ESC siteops took any action. If not, the
whole site is probably linked to p2p. Expect to hear from us again. Sorry we didnt
get this information out sooner, but it took a while for someone to step up.
