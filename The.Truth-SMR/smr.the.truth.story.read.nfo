Hello... at the last few weeks we heared rumours about some scene notice called: Warning.About.SMR.SCENE.NOTICE.READ.NFO-iND so we read it to see what is all about and 
it is realy sad to see,
How 2 ppl can risk a grp or maybe more then one grp and the members in it with some
lies and editing.

well first we werent got drroped from that usa site we drop it cause of a argument about slots request, those 2 ppl that were the siteops of that site 

nicks: BruT^L , Nookie

we arent sure that BruT^T was also full partner with Nookie but Nookie maked the scene notice and edit it , but seems like he (bruT^L) did 5mins affter the nfo was a member got this msg 

16:18 <-psyBNC> Tue Dec 21 15:16:15 :(BruT^L!BruT_L@Linknet-33075fb742.cable.ntl.com)
( -N-U-K-E-D- )- Release: Headrush 2004 LiMiTED PAL DVDR SMR Reason: bad.encode

16:18 <-psyBNC> Tue Dec 21 15:16:23 :(BruT^L!BruT_L@Linknet-33075fb742.cable.ntl.com) welldone fuckin lamer

(if u guys check right it was on the same date that the lies were spread, nfo was coinsidence ? we dont think so... )

so seems he wanna to do a childish revenge with Nookie and they maked the nfo 
about SMR cause they lost a pre because of the argument about the slots in the site.

Now the log of the argument: 

 15:02  <X? hi u here ? 
 15:03• <BruT^L> yep
 15:03• <[X]> sry he didnt asked for leechs + slots *:* ratio.
 15:03• <X]> cause he wait for me and u add us with slots greement.
 15:03• <[X]> then 
 15:03• <X> * leech * *:*
 15:03• <BruT^L> nookie said when u were added no leech slots so u need to talk to nookie
 15:03• <BruT^L> u want * leech slots?
 15:03• <X> * leech and * ratio
 15:04• <BruT^L> thats impossible
 15:04• <X> k i will talk with nookie.

Well the member talk with Nookie he didnt agree to the agreement.
we had to drop the site and we asked for deletion on the site, 
affter that Nookie said the grp will be sorry about what we did
cause he thaught we are greedy grp he didnt understed, that we have demands.
It hadn't need to be like that if the siteops werent hurry
to add grps and wait untill the agreement will be done.

---------------------------------
P.S: U dont have to belive us but this is the truth, ppl like that only 
kill the scence and risk the grps that in the scence and because of that type
of liars, grps leave the scence. 

---------------------------------
  
Okey, this is all. Peace - SMR -
