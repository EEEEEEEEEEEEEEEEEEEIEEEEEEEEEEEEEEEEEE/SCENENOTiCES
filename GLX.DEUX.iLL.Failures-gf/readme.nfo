About the included scans:
otp1.gif:
You sent 596 euros on end of november. (nah not 600 you were always fault-finding)

bill1.gif:
I bought the box on 30th of november, it was 9000 huf = 36 euro

bill2.gif:
the hw's on 3rd of december, it was 135000 huf = 540 euro

I also needed to buy extra sata cables, graphics card, which i have no bills about,
but we got the 596 euro...

The box was online from ~10th of december.

otp2.gif:
You sent 90 euro for hosting on 1st of january... for the hosting fee of december...

I think we have no more to discuss.
I was always tolerant for your lamenesses, but now it was enough.


1st: isp called me on the first day when the box was online, 
their router marked, that your box has changed its mac address.
So i changed root pw, and told you its me who will do scripting/etc in the future.
Of course you denied this, and were peeved. After crying like a baby that much
i said ok, but after the next failure i'll send back your box immediately.


2nd: so galaxis has started. Then you said "every prob seems to be solved, 
now you can leave #galaxis" 
I didnt understand wtf? Some hours later i was kicked out from the sitechan with
reason "internal"
This was the most foully thing you ever done.
Then you sent your asslickers for asking excuse.
And i gave you a new chance again...

3rd: german busts at end of january. So you stopped Galaxis and wanted to restart it
with a new name, new staff, new userbase. Since that fbi spy was added on your site either... 
i wonder why they did not bust it....
So i asked the isp for a new ip and you started DEUX.

4th: you messaged an unfortunately accident happened, some logs were pasted from the
staff chan to the site chan, and your traders/affils have leaved. I didnt understand
what the fuck they did this, and when you showed me logs it was about leech slots as far
as i noticed.
So you asked me for the old ip again, to start a new site with new name and new users...

5th: site name is illuminati now...
You messaged me that the box is offline... i called the isp asked them for reboot.
still offline, although support guy said the login prompt seems to be workin...
New call, asked them for ip based console (kvm or something like that)
it worked, and i could see interfaces are not up. /etc/networking/interfaces was okay
so i didnt understand whats up? i did /etc/init.d/networking restart (debian system) 
and the file was not found !  so i copied it back from another box via clipboard 
(since the box was not online) and /sbin/ifup missed either...
so i configured the interface with ifconfig, and downloaded that missing file.
after all of these the networkin script worked fine, after a reboot the box was online
successfully.
i am sure somebody did something nasty. then you said you would ask about this from your
american techop... oh god, why dont you work with fbi agents?
And he (or you?) lied again... the story was "he tried to encrypt the /etc partition"
this is stupid. without /etc you cant boot the os. two cases:
 #1: he is such stupid for linux administration
 #2: he simple lied for some reason.

6th: isp has called me that a thousands of email spams were sent out from the box
they got a lot of reports so they decided to turn off the box.
I checked spamcop and some another sites and the ip was blacklisted...

I am fed up with all of these and i dont trust you anymore at all.

You suspected me of being a liar several times. You never respected me, 
you are unsecure, and you still owe me the hosting fee of the last month.

Talk to a lawyer or the police as you said. lol, they are welcome 
proofs are on my side. 

Or travel to .hu and kick my ass. I will publish your realnames and do the same.

Dont answer. You are a failure. Cum shit and die, and leave me alone.
