So we used a mate of Supa's to do our nfo...so what.

all we asked at the start of the group was for someone to make an nfo.

BossPlaya is on none of our affil sites (check that if you want), as far as I know aint on any sites with any of our members, hasnt spoken to any of our members, has made 0 (thats right ZERO) releases for the group, and is not involved with us...in any other way than the made our nfo when we started...

What does this prove?

But hey, thanks for letting us know too...

***This nfo was created by d3mon for TR0UB13***
