This is just a notice to all siteops, I hope you take note of this and act to the best of your ability.

There is 1 group named TLF aka The Last Fantasy, this is an Asian group, firstly they release shit and secondly they sell leech on a various number of web sites, they have a forum board giving credits to people who post, and last and worst they have a torrent tracker.

They give access to their servers to the general public and this is one of the main sources for how PDA is leaked, this takes the piss and should not be allowed to happen.

I provide a various amount of screenshots as proof.

I recommend they are scene banned, all racers leave them and all siteops drop their affil.

--------------

As extra Im providing you with info on how I came about this.

One of my group members was asking a random person how they manage to get and post all PDA releases on a specific forum, as the shit wasnt available in DCC channels.

They came back with a server hostname / user + pw.

I simply googled the hostname and found a whole load more including ISO/APPS/PS2/XBOX etc...
