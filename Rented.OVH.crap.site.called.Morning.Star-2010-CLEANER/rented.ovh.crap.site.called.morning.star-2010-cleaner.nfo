Rented.OVH.crap.site.called.Morning.Star-2010-CLEANER

Hello again :(
Last time we found site with insecure site bot (without blowfish at linknet) now its time for OVH! 
Here is some site info where friends are guys from MuSiKa team (When sombody said that new groups are not so welcome i was thinking that its not a true but if new "scene" groups are added as friends on a rented OVH site then...)

We hope that our notice will be a little warning for guys who are planning to make "a great rented site with nice archives" or something in this type. Walls have ears ;-) If u wanna make ur own rented site just dont invite "outside" guys - make it for ur insecure friends...
5 .jpg`s and conversation with "rented fan" included. (Check ur sites IP: 188.167.3.166 .cz - its our "rented fan" we hope that u dont have him at ur site ;-) If u have u know what to do :P )
