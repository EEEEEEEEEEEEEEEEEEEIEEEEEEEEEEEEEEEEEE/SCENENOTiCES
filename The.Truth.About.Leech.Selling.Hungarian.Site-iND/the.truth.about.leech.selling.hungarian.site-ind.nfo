some old friend of me, nick: Dj_Wave, asked me to setup a .hu site..
i was like, why not... looked ok.. clear box.. guy was trustable
box owner was on vacations
so i set up the things
it went all good
till last night (27-july-2005)
owner returned
he added like 90 users to the fuckin site, and tried to hide them with a group called BFRiENDS
i didnt even see it, till a friend of mine told me !bw showed there were like 23 leechers currently leeching
i was like WTF
and asked the other siteops, they were like wtf too
2 mins later, i closed the site
owner didnt confess he was selling/giving away accounts
so i closed site
and left it immediately
thats like the basic story

I want you all guys to be aware that selling leech is lame, and people shouldn't make money from the scene.
Also, adding this much leeching people, is a big security risk.
I hope you all believe i was totally NOT involved with this selling/giving away leech accounts thing.
Not more i can say about it, its up to you if you believe it or not.

Watch out if you see the owners nick: brada or bradal.
Do not ever trust him.

I know some people thought BiNPDA was running this site, but thats absolutely NOT true.
It was true that i was gonna affiliate that site, since i really didn't know about that shit,
but we didn't run it at all. The only guy from BiNPDA involved was ME (flugel).

If there is any specific info you want to know about it, you can mail us @ BiNPDA@hushmail.com
