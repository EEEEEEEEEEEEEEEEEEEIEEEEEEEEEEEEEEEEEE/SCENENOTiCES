  This seems to be direct hit to the ring, unlike
  earlier. Owner was not running any p2p constantly
  and police was interested about the site box.

  Site in question was part of finnish ring, and it
  was taken down today by finnish police. For those
  concerned, it was hosted in Oulu, Finland. All 
  affils please take the precautions.

  Ring name: AF

  NOTE! This is uncorfirmed rumors, but site owner
  said they worked together with us customs in an
  effort to take down multiple scene groups. It
  was NOT directed to major groups, only against
  some lower level groups. If there has been 
  busts elsewhere, please report.

  Affil/users is not included, since it seems
  bust was just targeted about the site for now.
  However, if you were on the site in question,
  please take good precautions now while you still
  have time for it.

  More info follows later...
