Hello,

---------------------------------

You all have might seen the "Half Life 2 Source Code" leaked to scene,
wether this is a real source or not get it deleted everywhere.
And that -DLE that pred it should be scenebanned.
If this is the "real" sourcecode then we all are messed since that -DLE
is responsible for a huge spread and the FBI surely will investigate them, and off
course they will rollup any sites they are on.
So help me and get this thing out of scene and sites where it got pred think about your 
security and your users. (and about the jail penalty under the DMCA law for this).
