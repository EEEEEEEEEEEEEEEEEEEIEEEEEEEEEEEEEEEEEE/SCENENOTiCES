How sweet those nice releases straight leaking to p2p...
I thought the scene becoming lame due to losers that spread
releases to forums or whatsoever... Now the light shows us
that even a releasegroup cooperates with this... It's hilarious
how even such a big group with a name a lot of ppl respect
cooperates with this nonsense....

The proof pictures will show u the date of being uploaded, the id3
tag of what has been uploaded and the date of pre you can all look
up yourself. For those who are to lame to do it, check below. ;)

It shows us the release that has been uploaded on a forum, ofc we deliver
the link of what you were able to download there at 16:25. You can find
this lovely link at the bottom of the proof picture.

and of course we hosted the exact same .rar somewhere else, in case they
would be so smart to delete the link. OMG. Just check it out in case the
other doesn't work anymore. --> http://www.speedyshare.com/571767675.html

proof3
This shows us the exact time of date when the file was last changed.
No, we're not fuckin QMI, they're fuckin us all that try to keep the
scene as much secure as it can be. So NO FUCKING leaking!!!

Oh yes we love you QMI for leaking releases to p2p. Shame on you.
You give the scene a bad name and groups like u, nobody needs in the
scene. No, we HATE all those p2p leakers, and even now when it's clear
that even a respected group that definitly does not earn the credits
they get, cooperates with p2p ppl. That they even give releases earlier
then PRE-date... Maybe you guys should think about quitting. That won't
be a bad idea.

So all big MP3 groups... are we going to protect QMI AGAIN and be corrupt
or are we here for the REAL thing? Securing us from p2p. We'll see about
that and THAT in fact will show everybody what the MP3 scene will be worth.
It's great and we ban those who leak to p2p or whatsoever, or we do as if
nothing has happened... Let's finally do the first thing once, to be for real
a securer scene. No wonder it's soo easy for the feds these days...

And yes, you siteops!!! There's a job for you all. Those who have QMI as affil,
you're comfortable with users that leak stuff that comes from your sites, to
the p2p scene? You find it no problem that a group with such a low levelty risk
is on your site? Well as you can see it's a problem we gotta solve with each other.
That means, groups, users, nukers and siteops. We MUST secure the scene, not
opening it up for all those people that LOVE p2p. Let p2p die!

Hopefully those who really have an heart for the scene will listen and stand up
to groups like QMI who are spreading the scene releases to p2p. This proofs that
they send out their releases before pre, so probably other releases a few minutes
after pre...
