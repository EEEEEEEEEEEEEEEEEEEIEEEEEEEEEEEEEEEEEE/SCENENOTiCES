Well, im siteopping on a site where -SNUTARNA is/was affiling.
One of the grpmembers came to me and said that he wanted to
leave the grp, and i asked why..

He said that the founder of snutarna is sellng leech for $10,
and is opping in a dchub.

proof.bmp is a printscreen of the hub that hes opping in, with
his ip-adress included, same ip as on linknet:

(00:40:49)  —› NicZon is "NicZon" (niczon@adsl-3e74f220.gavlenet.com)
(00:40:49)  —› NicZon using link-net.org (LinkNet IRC Network)
(00:40:49) (( /whois end ))
(00:40:57)     —› dns: resolving (niczon)...
(00:40:57)     —› dns: resolved (adsl-3e74f220.gavlenet.com) to (62.116.242.32)

What i dont got proofs on, is that he's selling leech. It's just what the
grpmember told me.

So I say: SCENEBAN THiS FUCKING MORON!

Over and out.
