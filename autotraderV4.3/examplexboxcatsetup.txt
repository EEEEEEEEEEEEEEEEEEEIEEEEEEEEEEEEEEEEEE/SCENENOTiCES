OK lets look at the example rules.....................

1. Only PAL and USA releases.
2. No PAL after USA/NTSC
3. No Rips - Full CDs or DVD.
4. MULTI dupes PAL and NTSC
5. Current year releases ONLY

Now i shall assume you have already added XBOX as a category and set FXPTO/FROM and pretime etc

So here i shall try to explain about wildcards

I prefer to use .PAL. for example instead of PAL incase of a release with PAL in the name.
This of course makes it harder because the rlz could be -PAL- or _PAL_ or even _PAL- :p

PLEASE NOTE: NONE OF THE CHECKS ARE CASE-SENSITIVE

So lets get onto the rules:

1. Only PAL and USA releases.
=============================
For this rule i would add the following to my ALLOW -> !.PAL. !_PAL_ !.NTSC !_NTSC_ !.USA. !_USA_
Of course you could just add !PAL !USA !NTSC if you want.
So as long as one of these is in the rlz name it will be allowed. Now i hear you say what if this is not in the rlz name.

Because if you use wildcards 1 HAS TO BE FOUND for the rlz to pass the ALLOW check. It may still fail the DENY check tho.

Heres where it gets difficult. Now if you know a group like ALLSTARS that always does PAL then add !-ALLSTARS to your allow.
Now if you read my other little docs you will know that groups are added as -GRPNAME.
You will notice here i have used a ! so its !-GRPNAME. This is because if i did -ALLSTARS then only ALLSTARS would be
allowed. The ! means that -ALLSTARS is a wildcard so all ALLSTARS releases will be allowed.
Simply if a group (-GRPNAME) is in allow and is not found then the release is ignored. So by adding as a wildcard this group
is allowed but so are others as long as PAL/NTSC etc is in the rlz name. Of course its up to you how you set all this up.
Hope you get it.
After all that my ALLOW would be : !.PAL. !_PAL_ !.NTSC !_NTSC_ !.USA. !_USA_ !-ALLSTARS

2. No PAL after USA/NTSC
========================
OK here you need a dupecheck. This also goes in ALLOW. Please note that this is only effective if you have INDEXED your site(s) from the FIND tab.
Dupecheck simply works by specifying what to find in rlz name, followed by a | (shift \), then followed by what it dupes,
if its a list just seperate each item with a comma.

So for this example i would put .PAL.|.NTSC.,.USA.

IMPORTANT: If you use .'s the script automatically compares . and _ and -. So please use them.

3. No Rips - Full CDs or DVD.
=============================
My knowledge is poor here so i simply have !.RIP. in my DENY.

4. MULTI dupes PAL and NTSC
===========================

So another dupecheck in ALLOW. And yes its as simple as .MULTI.|.PAL.,.USA.,.NTSC.

5. Current year releases ONLY
=============================

Um only difficulty here is that every year you will need to update all your sites :p
Simply add in your DENY <2006 as 2006 is the current year as i type. The script checks back about 60 years so if a date is
in the release name then it will be ignored if less than 2006. I am aware xbox games rarely put the date in so obviously
this probably will not work. But its worth adding to be on the safe side.

And thats it. I hope you get all that and can use what you have learned here to apply to other categories.

Thank you for reading and goodbye :p
