!!! IMPORTANT !!!

**** Your mirc path cannot contain spaces - c:/program files/mirc WILL NOT WORK ****
**** DO NOT USE THE FTPRUSH MIRC DLL - YOU NEED THE TMUK ONE FROM THE REGISTERED USERS AREA ****

Your FTPRUSH must be a registered copy for the TMUK IRC dll to work
FTPRUSH must be installed in its default place of c:/program files/ftprush
The TMUK RUSHMIRC.DLL must be placed in your main MIRC directory

Unpack this archive to your main mirc dir making the directory FxpCheat in the main mirc dir.

When unpacking unpack to mirc dir and the fxpcheat dir and subdirectories are automatically created

Please DO-NOT remove any empty dirs created as at least they are all inside the FXPCHEAT dir.

On older version a beta-tester said his anti-virus said a file was a virus. THERE IS NO VIRUS IN MY SCRIPT.
There is no encoded script of any type and the only /ctcp commands are for version info ONLY(AT THE MOMENT).

Script currently tested on mirc 6.16. Please use this version or newer ONLY.

MOST IMPORTANTLY - REPORT BUGS IMMEDIATELY - THIS HELPS EVERYONE - AND USEFUL ADDITIONS ARE ALSO ACCEPTED

You can email me at traitor4lifenew@hotmail.co.uk (But i don't check daily)

This script will auto-load all the other required files. NOTE THAT SOME SCRIPTS LIKE INVISION WILL NOT ALLOW THIS.

BIG THANKS TO:

All those people that originally gave me the idea for this project and supplied me with info to get it going. And thanks for the
feedback and beta-testing. U know who u r.


LASTLY:

If you are an experienced mirc scripter(i am definately not) or just think mirc script is just lame please keep it to yourself.
Don't flame me for trying.
