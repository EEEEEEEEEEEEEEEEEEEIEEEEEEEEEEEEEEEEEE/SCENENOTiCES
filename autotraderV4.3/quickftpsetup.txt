Open AUTOFXP and using the ? button under the RUSH FTP NAME LIST add the site by clicking its name.

Now enter the server using the format <server!tofind>
E.g the server is noidea.wherever.dunno:7000 so enter that as server.
A lot of servers will rename etc upon connection the server name may be urhere.whereever.dunno
TOFIND is a wildcard so here you could use WHEREVER if WHEREVER is always in the server name.
So your server name would be noidea.wherever.dunno:7000!whereever. This is also useful if the server is an IP address.

Now you need to enter your nick/login for the site.

Once entered hit connect. To automatically join this site when IRC loads please select the AUTO-JOIN option.

Upon connection to the server FTPRUSH should login in and you should be invited into the channel(s).

Now assuming you have the FTP still selected you now need to add channels.

IF YOU DO-NOT AUTO-JOIN THE CHANNELS JOIN NOW. WHEN ADDED TO SCRIPT YOU WILL AUTO-JOIN NEXT TIME.

Under the CHANNELS LIST there should be a button called ADD A CHANNEL. (If the button is called NOT CONNECTED please re-select your FTP)
Hit this button and select the channels you want to watch by clicking them.

I will not talk about CATEGORIES here as it is a very big subject.

Next you need to add ANNOUNCERS. Under ANNOUNCE NICK on the MAIN tab should be a button ADD NICK.
Hit this and add all the nicks that announce in channel such as NEW/PRE/COMPLETE ETC.

Now a quick example of adding announcer catcher. Lets add NEW.

Copy the announcers NEW line from the channel ensuring you hold down CTRL to copy the colour codes etc.
Hit the T button on the right-hand end of the NEW IN textbox. Paste the advert into the big textbox into the popup window.
The advert is split into numbered boxes. Enter the relevant box number into the little boxes at the bottom.
This will get the required information. Now we need catch text. This is text that always appears in the announce, so for a NEW
release NEW is quaranteed to appear. If not sure look back for more NEW announcements and put those words into the CATCH TEXT.
When finished hit APPLY.

If you wish to test this or at any point notice that releases do not seem to be being captured then use the VALIDATE button.

Here you simply paste the full announce line and the script will tell you which announcers would capture that addy.
Do not worry if more than 1 announcer catches it - many sites use the same scripts - but what you are looking for is if the announcer
in the channel you are having problems with is catching it and is the capture type right. If it is all ok then turn on debugs because
it may well be you have not set your ftp/categories up right.

NOW BEFORE YOU START SHARING MAKE SURE YOU DO THE FOLLOWING IF POSSIBLE AS IT MAKES THE SCRIPT MUCH QUICKER
===========================================================================================================
Setup a pre-chan - this is especially important for added speed
Index your sites(You can manually add other directories such as archive using the ADD button)
Indexing is used for dupechecks/requests(eventually)/stopping wasted sends......USE IT
Add /cd1 /cd2 /cd3 /cd4 to the INCLUDE IN RLZ on the IGNORE OPTS TAB. And anything else of course.

And thats it.

Have fun.

P.S I added all those AUTO features for nicks/ftps/channels etc to reduce problems with typos.
