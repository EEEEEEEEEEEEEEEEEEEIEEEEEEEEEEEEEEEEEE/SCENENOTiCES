hello everyone , here are some proofs about an OLD "good" and "secure" site , you should judge by yourself , the owner is running torrent on his site box , he got additional storage for bittorent usage and he is constantly spreading DVDR rlses on russian trackers ( the nfo about storage came from his OWN friend)
proof1.bmp shows the ip of the owner on the tracker ( 213.219.122.53)  , allso this ip is SO simillar to the Passive IP on the BOX itself(213.219.122.52) (colocation usually gives you at least 4 ips) so this is our guy 99.99999%
my recomendation to all affils on this site to drop it immediately because of this huge security problem.
let the pictures speak for themselfs.

Thanks for your attention .
