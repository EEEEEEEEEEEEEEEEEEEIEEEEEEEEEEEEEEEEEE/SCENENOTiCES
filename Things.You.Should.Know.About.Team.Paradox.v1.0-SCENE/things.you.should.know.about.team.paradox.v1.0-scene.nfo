"The Truth Shall Set You Free"

 The following is an accurate and true account of all events that have
 transpired between the PARADOX and AGAiN as well as DWP, SSG, and Midnight.
 By no means is this an entire and complete description of PARADOX's actions,
 many others have had these same occurences and we all understand the
 seriousness of this situation. The mentioned incidents below are but a few of
 numerous accusations and issues with them. For security purposes all
 conversation by the PARADOX leader will be referred to as "pdx-1", AGAiN
 leader will be "again-1" and SSG leader will be "ssg-1".

 First let us begin with how the entire "Fight" started between AGAiN and
 PARADOX, later we will bring in a few other groups who have been attacked by
 "pdx-1".

 It began on September 26th, 2003, we wont spend much time on this subject as
 it involved mostly TDA and PARADOX, however AGAiN did provide the crack for
 TDA in the subject release. In short summary, AGAiN cracked Macromedia Studio
 MX 2004, and PARADOX claimed AGAiN stole the crack from them, even after
 AGAiN offered proof they did not. Thus it began.

 After that things quieted down a bit after "pdx-1" made his usual threats of
 having AGAiN banned everywhere. Move forward now to November 10th, 2003.
 PARADOX had released a beta of Adobe Photoshop CS. AGAiN propered them with a
 valid reason and clear proof that theirs was final. Not one minute after the
 pre (before "pdx-1" even had time to check) AGAiN was messaged claiming they
 stole PARADOX's supply. AGAiN suggested to him read the NFO, after which he
 said AGAiN did "Good". Thanks "pdx-1" :)

 Move forward to November 16th, 2003 and MIDNIGHT's 3 releases of Adobe
 Version Cue, GoLive, and InDesign finals.. Seems PARADOX has done the
 unthinkable.. Exactly what they accuse half the other groups in scene of..
 Releasing beta's and calling them legitimate. Same can be said for their
 Illustrator CS and Photoshop CS releases. Say it with us.. Hypocrites!

 And this is not the only time PARADOX have released beta's of apps.. Even
 times where they have attempted to disguise beta's by hex editing beta words
 from every .exe. Apparently they are in need of new crackers, as maybe they
 get beta's and don't have them cracked until release date of final.. Forcing
 them to disguise it.

 Flash forward to November 26th, 2003 and SSG's release of Canopus ProCoder.
 If you want detailed accounts of this please read NFO from them found with
 this release. In general, PARADOX crack was not working, they missed some
 encrypted code, and SSG created a proper crack which did work.. After which
 PARADOX claimed SSG stole their crack even though theirs did not work and
 SSG's did! More, SSG's files has different dates, different size, they
 decrypted code, missed by PARADOX, that means they have their own dongle. So,
 own setup, own dongle, but amazing, still claiming that SSG's crack is stolen
 :)

 In the meanwhile AGAiN continued on releasing quite a number of great apps
 and also some keygens of AutoDesk apps which PARADOX released. This caused
 "pdx-1" to msg AGAiN again and claim the usual, and we quote:

 <pdx-1> u know that all thise autodeks keygens are useless?
 <pdx-1> those apps are network aps
 <pdx-1> and with the kg u can only work standalone with it
 <pdx-1> aka useless

 AGAiN mostly ignored this even though AGAiN was aware of his flawed logic
 based on the fact PARADOX licenses were already blacklisted in the newest
 updates and many people do work with standalone AutoDesks, not over networks.
 So it continued.

 Move forward to December 27th, 2003 and DWP release of Maxon Cinema4D
 non-stolen serials. As always for detailed Information read their NFO on this
 release. In summary "pdx-1" agreed with DWP leader to not release this app
 for several months because company was suffering financial difficulties due
 to piracy.. So DWP leader trusted "pdx-1" and gave him some serials to
 internally test this app. Shortly after PARADOX took those serials and
 released them with their app without permission.. So much for honor and
 trust.

 On to February 6th, 2004 when PARADOX released Adobe Photoshop working
 SafeCast keygen and attacked MIDNIGHT and other groups in their NFO saying
 and we quote:

 "Once again we proove .. big words and troublemakers like mdn/dwp are always
 the losers. but hey! pdx ROX !!"

 Another example of how everyone else in the scene does not deserve to be here
 except for PARADOX.. We begin to think PARADOX bitches and tries to prove
 they are superior to everyone else more than they release.

 Three days later on to DWP release of Illustrate 5.3 keygen.. Not much to say
 here except further proof PARADOX simply cannot keygen and takes cheap way
 around protections by patching and making sloppy cracks.. But then again you
 all probably already knew that.

 Things remained quiet after that, until middle of February when AGAiN
 discovered (as stated in their previous NFO) that the Crosslight apps pred as
 "working" by PARADOX, were in fact not working as they expired 2 months after
 the release date! Anyways AGAiN mentioned all these things before and you
 know this part of story. PARADOX claimed in their NFO in September that AGAiN
 was and I quote:

 "in lack of skills when it comse to REAL protections"

 Apparently AGAiN share this same lack of skills with them.

 Flash forward to February 20th, 2004 and SSG release of Digital Video The
 Tab. PARADOX can keygen!! But hrm.. What are these Quicktime files and other
 bullshit we find in half of PARADOX releases.. anyways.. read NFO from SSG
 for more information.

 Jump forward now to March 3rd, 2004 and SSG release of Adobe Photoshop
 keygen. Again read summary in NFO for detailed information. Basically PARADOX
 keygenned Photoshop activation but didn't keygen installation serials!
 Exactly after this release "pdx-1" msged "ssg-1" and I quote:

 <pdx-1> whats the prob with u ppl?
 <pdx-1> dont let mdn use u for hes wars
 <ssg-1> let whom use?
 <ssg-1> don't be so idiot, dude
 <pdx-1> he use u for hes things
 <ssg-1> you blamed us in stoling your crack and now talking about some wars?!
 <ssg-1> just fuck off.
 <pdx-1> it was stolen and u know it
 <pdx-1> and yoru adobe keygen
 <pdx-1> haha
 <pdx-1> what a joke
 <pdx-1> only for english version
 <pdx-1> lol
 <ssg-1> again - fuck off, please.
 <pdx-1> u act liek newbie kids
 <ssg-1> all i can say - what i've already said - we NEVER stole our releases.
 <pdx-1> then talk to them
 <ssg-1> instead of
 <pdx-1> well
 <pdx-1> ok
 <pdx-1> i have expirience wiuth bigmouth guys like u
 <pdx-1> zone
 <pdx-1> oxygen
 <pdx-1> mdn
 <pdx-1> nw u
 <pdx-1> and they are all dead
 <pdx-1> u want trouble
 <pdx-1> ok :)

 Just after that "pdx-1" asked siteop of SSG's WHQ to drop SSG. He said "no"
 and dropped PARADOX from the site instead of SSG. PARADOX said they did it on
 purpose to be dropped from this site. Funny, isn't it? ;)

 Moving on, we jump to present where one of AGAiN members had some words for
 "pdx-1". "pdx-1" explained to him when "pdx-1" messaged AGAiN about it, that
 AGAiN did not support these messages nor encourage them however it was
 useless, "pdx-1" was looking for a fight. After discussing this matter for
 several minutes "pdx-1" came to this decision, and I quote:

 <pdx-1> tomorow again is banned from all pdx affils

 AGAiN ignored this threat as it has been made before, however his
 conversation did not end there, and we will now provide this in full unedited
 form as we feel it will be of great interest to the other groups he spoke of.
 Here it is as follows.. and I quote:

 <pdx-1> i alwys have such lame groups
 <pdx-1> oxygen
 <pdx-1> zone
 <pdx-1> mdn
 <pdx-1> ssg
 <pdx-1> now u
 <pdx-1> they are all dead
 <again-1> ssg dead?
 <again-1> lol
 <pdx-1> and remeber
 <pdx-1> i warned u
 <again-1> mdn dead?
 <pdx-1> and u have nothing better to do then to act like newbie kids
 <pdx-1> i wonder witch idiot let u kids on sites
 <pdx-1> but ok
 <again-1> i dont act like that, i cant be responsible for what ****** does
 <pdx-1> i will fix this
 <pdx-1> only kids act like this
 <pdx-1> oxygen was same
 <pdx-1> zone
 <pdx-1> mdn
 <pdx-1> they bite the dust
 <again-1> mdn rox, ssg rox
 <again-1> face the fact
 <pdx-1> sure
 <again-1> pdx is going deeper into the shit
 <pdx-1> mdn release 1 app per month
 <pdx-1> they acterd like u
 <pdx-1> thats why they are dead
 <pdx-1> the spend more time on bitching
 <pdx-1> u do same
 <pdx-1> and u will kill yoruself too
 <again-1> prolly coz they had reasons to bitch
 <pdx-1> thats why they are dead
 <pdx-1> couse they had a reason
 <pdx-1> lame groups always die after 2 yeahrs
 <pdx-1> again will do the same now

 Don't you see the same storyline as with SSG? Looks like ravings of the
 idiot. The conversation continues into already covered territory about AGAiN
 Crosslight apps and other ways in which he claims AGAiN and the other
 mentioned groups suck and how all of those groups will die and be "owned" by
 PARADOX.

 Over the course of the above mentioned events PARADOX has bashed, attacked,
 insulted, and attempted to get DWP/SSG/MDN and AGAiN and many others banned
 from every site possible.. AGAiN was dropped from PARADOX's WHQ for no
 reason. AGAiN was also banned on 2 PARADOX HQs. How long is the scene going
 to accept this total and complete lack of respect for anyone?

 PARADOX claims other groups are ruining the scene with our constant bitching
 and complaining and that we are inferior to them.. We are here for one
 purpose, because we care for the scene and try to release working and
 properly cracked apps for everyone to use. We do not directly attack PARADOX
 or only proper PARADOX releases.. And what do we get for this? Banned on
 sites, bitched at, delusered, and attacked from every side.

 The truth lies above.. Its time once and for all to say to PARADOX we care
 about quality! We care about the users! Winning is not the most important
 thing.. And surely bitching and complaining about everyone who dares to
 proper or oppose you is not the way to true success.

 You can be the difference.. Show PARADOX what the scene is meant to be.

 We stand united:
 AGAiN BLACKSTAR CROSSFIRE DISTINCT DWP MIDNIGHT RENEGADE SSG
