Tonight we wanna inform all siteops and sceners about a user who is siteoping 1 sitering, 
and having a active account on the torrentbytes.net torrent-tracker wich he downloads from 
and uploads from. We Caught this guy, and got printscreen proofs. Worst thing is that he,
siteops 1 sitering, if 1 siteop is involved with p2p stuff, what about the other siteops on
the same site? Do they know about him? Do they also use p2p? Who knows. If i were you, i should
drop that sitering asap. It's a big security risk also.

Anyway...The user is Ixelion. He got that nick on EFnet, After-All and LinkNet.
Also using the same nickname on the torrent tracker, clever. He uses a bnc/vhost.
The torrent page says Ixelion is from Netherlands, and that is correct, he is from .nl
Even if this guy didnt trade much during those 5 days he is still guilty. 

--------------------------------------------------
Ixelion is ixelion@66.232.107.25 * Ixelion
Ixelion on @#*** @#*** 
Ixelion using link-net.org LinkNet IRC Network
Ixelion is an SSL Encrypted Client
Ixelion End of /WHOIS list.
---------------------------------------------------

I decided not to say the sitename of the sitering Ixelion is oping on, But we wanna see actions!!!

Remember, even if those pictures are not enough proof, i warned ya. I wish more people took action
and report known people on p2p networks. If you decide to stay on this sitering, thats up to you
but i did my best, and im happy about it.

Cya fellas! Have a weekend!
