here it is people the real truth about this group YPOGEiOS they have major leaks of torrent sites like scenetorrents,torrentbytes,sceneaccess there releases are just
rubbish so they can obtain access to nice sites to be able to leak scene pres onto these torrent sites. username on scene torrents (NeVes) is one of there guys.
all there shells are @ ovh.net and leaseweb.
so ban this group from every site you can they are dangerious and a scene risk to us all.

O U R     C O M M E N T S




"here it is people the real truth about this group YPOGEiOS they have major leaks of torrent sites like scenetorrents,torrentbytes,sceneaccess"

Pretty funny, first you spam our releases, then you release fake releases, then you write a nfo that

 1. doesnt make sense
 2. insulting a grp of supporting p2p
 3. just plain text without even 1 screenshot or ip addie
 
It just doesnt make sense if we have axx to fast scene sites why would we support torrent sites? Pretty suspicous how you managed to mention the leaking details step by step. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

"there releases are just rubbish so they can obtain access to nice sites to be able to leak scene pres onto these torrent sites."

Again  why  would a grp support  the torrent stuff if  they have axx to nice sites?  Rubbish releases oh .. so now its the  releases who're sucking ass... it just doesnt make sense. Just a hater who is acusing us of supporting torrents

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

"username on scene torrents (NeVes) is one of there guys."

For safety reasons ygs is not going in further details about the members. We never had a member with the handle NeVeS, we know  that for 100%. Its pretty funny how you wrote an nfo, accuse the grp of  supporting torrents, mentioning a  fake handle  probably... Isnt that suspicious? YPOGEiOS has  nothing  to do  with torrents, this  is just a false accuse of some hater who didnt even think  twice before he started with all this bullshit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

"all there shells are @ ovh.net and leaseweb."

To be honest I even never heard of those services, why? Because I dont need them, how do you know them? I bet you are the one of the biggest leaker, you're the true danger for the scene.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

"so ban this group from every site you can they are dangerious and a scene risk to us all."

For  what   reason?   First of   all,   since   the   first   releases   some   clown   released  a  fake  release  (LMAOEIOS), then
some one releases fake trainers using our grp  name, nuke our  releases  without even having a valid reason, then you (probably  the hater) writes a no-sense  making nfo file  about  YPOGEiOS  leaking scene releases on torrents? I smell  a hater... people  like you should get scenebanned for fucking around with hardworking groups.

We are totally against torrents, never or will support them, this asshole just wrote a fake  no-sense nfo file in hope siteops  will believe him and ban us, on this planet not everybody is stupid as you might guess. By reading your fake accuse its  clear you  didnt make it at school, so hate the people who are better then you.

Releases of every group leak,  ofcourse  we do hate it its  dangerous  for everybody. back in the torrent free days maybe a few  100 people would get a rls, with the torrents 100 000 000 people get a release.  You think YPOGEiOS would take the risk? For an  example go to google type any grp name in + torrent you will see how many results you will get, so should we scene ban every  grp?  Releases do leak but not by us, we wrote some scene news nfo against p2p lamers, so why would we leak our releases on torrents if we know the damage it can cause?

Your story was just full of false incorrect shit, go waste some one elses time instead of hating us.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Conclusion: that in-correct story was just a fake attempt of a frustrated scener trying to hate us, since we didnt give him a lot of attention he got worst and worst so he came and made up a fake story about YPOGEiOS supporting torrents after  he  spammed our rlses and nuked our releases on lame sites. The proof he is lying and a p2p user?

 1. How does he know all those torrent links?
 2. Why did he mention a handle without even showing a screenshot or an IP?
 3. Why does he concludes to ban us from everysite without even having a descent story nor proof?
 4. Why is it suspicious that our rlses got spammed, nuked (invalid reasons on lame sites), fake rlses got pred, and  then  he  lied
    about us?  Siteops  open your  eyes  and ban  this dumbfuck  from your sites, he is THE risk, who knows  how  far  this  asshole
    would go? He could betray us all, since his mission failed! He needs to get banned now, he is a risk for us all.
    he lied, spammed,  released fake  releases  with  our  group name, he hate us for some unknown  reason so  he would go that  far
    that he would contact the feds. Is he really worth that? Is he  an important person? I dont think so, its one person vs  a  hard
    working grp. Beside this hater could also  have  been  the mind behind other grp spam like GAYLAWS NiGERATi and all those  other 
    spam shit we have seen the last days. I suggest we ban him, the scene isnt a play ground for kids.
    
    
    S P E C i A L   W O R D S   F O R   T H E   H A T E R
    
    The game  is  over for you,  just  give  up  you  cannot  beat us.  Instead  of  hating  and fooling  around  you  could improve
    your skills, you're the one  who  made  fun of his self, you're in a hole you'll never climb out. You tought you could break our 
    team  by  spreading  lies,  nukings and false releases. You are the one who's heart  beats  like  hell  when  your releases gets
    released, you're the one who cannot sleep of all  the  rage and  anger because team YPOGEiOS didnt give  you all  the  attention
    you wanted. You're  the  one who  is burning from inside when we release. You're the one who have lost. You're the one who  will
    get scene banned, thats a promise. Game over dude.
