SECURiTY NOTICE - 100 MBiT SCENE

Today we was asked to change an ip like normally over iRC. We were asked by a
trader called <trader-nick>´ instead of <trader-nick> . We didn't notice
the little ` in the end of nick. Unfortunatly it wasn't the right trader,
but a hacker who in some way had got our ops- and trader nicks. Same time
we was asked to trial at another new 100mbit-site with great pretimes and
great affils. We told our addlines as usual, but never got an ip due to
"bw-problems". In fact it wasn't a TRiAL offer - just a way to get a
siteops pass to hack our site ring with. In our logs we have found out that
his ip is: 81.165.41.110 . Please go on and read the logs, its real
important that this won't happen anymore to other site rings.

SiTEOP = me in logs
