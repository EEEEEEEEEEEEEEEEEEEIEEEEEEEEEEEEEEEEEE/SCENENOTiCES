Tv groups seem to leak more and more into the p2p scene then we know of.
It came to our attention that the gadmin of ETACH leaked SWE-TV into a channel called #bacYard on After-all.org, this channel was known by members of #swebits on FreeQeust.

Releases from TFOi, ETACH and aAF are completed on #seedit within the 2 min., and we ask ourselfs how the fuck is this possible.Wel at least one member of a TV group was caught autoing all SWE-TV into a seedbox channel.

The nick niggapls is a welknown dude in p2p land and is scene-banned several times, this he has connections with the scene and knows ppl that help him to slots.
samST another nick we all know idles in the #swebits and helps out with the uploads.
