

Well here we go again PoPP aka MaZterN aka Lillpojken aka vearstingen aka keff aka Erra ! 



This guy regains scene-access all the time and as u can see has no intention off stop leaking material.


He has already been busted a couple of times:


Lillpojken.aka.maztern.leaking.to.swebits-iND

A.BiG.NOTE.ABOUT.SWEBiTS.UPLOADERS.FUN.READING-WEHATEP2P

PoPP.aka.MaZterN.strikes.again-SCENEBAN

A.Few.Leaks.From.SWEBiTS.org-LaF



We assume that this is his 5 time on the scene. Someone is helping him back to the scene all the time and we're freaking tired of it!


He says himself that he has been busted 4 times:


(+vearstingen) själv har jag åkt på 4 scen ban :$

(+vearstingen) I have been scene-banned 4 times :$


This guy is everywhere as u can see in proof3.jpg.

(vearstingen)  vafan, gief 500 =P


Helpmeplx is his nick on seedit.org


This guy is also a staffmember on starbits.se



Missed to mask his ip: - › Join: vearstingen (vearstinge@89.160.81.22)


Check the other nfo's for past ip's and more information maybe he still has a box on some site, we know he did before.




This guy whos name is Andreas Jonsson 


Has  Sky Communications in Sweden AB  100/100 MB/s and a box with 1007,68GB disk space, he runs windows on it. 

His addline is accordingly to him: Erra hejsan123 *@89.160.81.105* 



Maybe ban 89.160.81* on your sites?


He claims that he has static ip


But as u can see in proof6.jpg he changes his ip-address a lot, maybe for security reasons so that he can keep leaking scene-material


Why not: 


abuse@skycom.se





We're very tired of this guy!


ante_543@hotmail.com -> Mail he uses for msn chatting, not that anyone would be interested in dating this douche bag but anyway..


Andreas_Dif@hotmail.com -> His mail for some p2p-tracker registrations


Do whatever u want with these email-addresses...we don't care!






We've had enough..



This has to END!



So please, every siteop out there, take the time and PURGE him!




A big thanks to:
