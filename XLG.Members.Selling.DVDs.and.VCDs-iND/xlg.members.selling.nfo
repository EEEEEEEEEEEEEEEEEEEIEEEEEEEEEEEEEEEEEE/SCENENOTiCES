First off here is all logs...
The reason why the first log is different format to the other 2 is because it came from a different person in a site channel.
Names unrelated to this notice have been replaced with (***)
BOSSDOGG and XeminemX are the people selling. They are both in the group XLG. bbrixon in this first log is also in XLG.

[3:10:07 a] <bbrixon> i cant believe u guys are still using 2 disk releases! everytime I download something from you, I have to convert it to one disc.
[3:10:29 a] <(***)> who's u guys?
[3:10:34 a] <(***)> (***) doesnt pre here
[3:10:34 a] <(***)> why you have to convert to 1 disc?
[3:10:37 a] <(***)> 2 are better than 1
[3:10:57 a] <(***)> who is QFX
[3:11:23 a] <bbrixon> but I dont loose any quality from the movie.
[3:11:39 a] <bbrixon> and I save a disc when I'm burning.

[3:12:06 a] <(***)> hehe
[3:12:38 a] <bbrixon> oh well, just trying to save you all a disc when your gonna burn it off your HD.
[3:13:04 a] <(***)> maybe to you it doesn't look any different but im sure to other ppl it would ;)
[3:13:39 a] <bbrixon> ask BOSS he does the same thing and he sells them and no one has complained yet
[3:14:00 a] <(***)> siteop here?
[3:16:11 a] <(***)> first off the word sell does not exist here if thats what someone is doing we do NOT need to know and 2nd we will see him in jail soon
[3:17:15 a] <(***)> 2 make profit on someone elses work is really lame

Session Ident: XeminemX_
[16:43] <me> did you know boss is selling dvds & vcds
[16:44] <XeminemX_> how do u know he sells vcd and dvds
[16:44] <XeminemX_> who saw it
[16:44] <me> bbrixon said in (***) he did
[16:44] <me> and then boss said in convo to me he did
[16:44] <XeminemX_> i know but so wad if he sells
[16:44] <XeminemX_> nothing wrong wit dat
[16:45] <XeminemX_> i do too

XeminemX_ is ~XeminemX@cm32.epsilon193.maxonline.com.sg * XeminemX
XeminemX_ on #Xs0yX
XeminemX_ using link-net.org LinkNet IRC Network
XeminemX_ End of /WHOIS list.


XeminemX also uses the nicks Salomon, Under, and AmazingRed. his ip is 222.164.193.32


Both of these people are members of the group XLG. XeminemX is the current leader of XLG although it used to be e***v****x
Since XeminemX has been leader of XLG he got the group onto a number of sites as affils and got himself leech.
Going by the number of nukes XLG have recently had I would say it's possible he has been running XLG only to be able to get leech on sites for himself & bossdogg to assist in profiting from the scene.


If you have anyone from XLG on your site you should deluser them immediately.
