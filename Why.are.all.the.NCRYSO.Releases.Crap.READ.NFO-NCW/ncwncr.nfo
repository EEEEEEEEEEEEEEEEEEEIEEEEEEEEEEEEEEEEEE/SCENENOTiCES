       Why the hell is NCRYSO blaming MAX for using the free tool StarFuck from www.project-starfuck.tk ?
       Maybe the answer is that the leet guys at NCRYSO are using StarFuck as well ?
       Lets have a deeper look into the mysterious temporary directory
       created by the so called "loader" from NCRYSO for the game The Fall:

       devcon.dll              <= DLL to control the devicemanager
                                  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q311272
       Language                <= languages subdir from the original StarFuck release
       logo.gif                <= Ohh well thats a nice logo done by NCRYSO wow !!
       ncrclean.exe            <= StarForce Drivers Removal Tool
                                  http://www.onlinesecurity-on.com/protect.phtml?c=55 
       ncrdev.exe              <= Starfuck version 0.77, shame on you NCRYSO 0.81 already out :P
       ncrinacl.exe            <= SubInACL is a command-line tool that enables administrators to obtain 
                                  security information about files, registry keys.....
                                  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&displaylang=en
       ncrrb.exe               <= RapidBATCH mhh they need a batch interpreter here /* no comment */
       ncrwait.exe             <= WAIT.EXE (c) by TBD in June 1996.
       ncrwait.rb              <= expectedly .rb is the RapidBATCH file extension
       primary_agressive.ini   <= seems like a StarFuck ini file doesnt it ?
       primary_light.ini       <= seems like a StarFuck ini file doesnt it ? 
       primary_tfall.mod       <= seems like a StarFuck config file doesnt it ? 
       secondary_agressive.ini <= seems like a StarFuck ini file doesnt it ? 
       secondary_light.ini     <= seems like a StarFuck ini file doesnt it ?      
       secondary_tfall.mod     <= seems like a StarFuck config file doesnt it ? 
       Settings.Ini            <= seems like a StarFuck ini file doesnt it ?
       tfall.ico               <= ohoh some kind of ico file nice work :P 
       tfallcd.ini             <= seems like a StarFuck ini file doesnt it ?
       TheFall.mdf             <= muuah seems THiS is the MiniImage eh ?
       TheFall.mds             <= Alcohol120% file for the MiniImage or ?
       thefall_tmp.exe         <= HERE it is, the original thefall.exe !
       zlportio.sys            <= yeah yeah, to bad StarFuck also needs this driver to enable the port hack :)


       Okay so seems its quite clear now that NCRYSO is using the tool Starfuck as well.
       But they try to hide it with a nice looking GUI and call it a "loader" thats all.
        
       Almost all NCRYSO releases of the last days are DUPES of MiniImage Clone Releases in the past.
       For example GTR.Fia.GT.Racing.Game.GERMAN-NCRYSO is DUPE of GTR.GERMAN.MI.Clone-NCW 
        
       Citation from a NCRYSO nfo:
       "Lil' notice to MAX (remember your Shade rel, hmm?): Next time just pack a freeware text editor as "crack", would be  
        better than stealing StarFuck for your release."
         
       And for once we agree,
       but NCRYSO please dont even try to release a freeware text-editor-loader pleeease dont try it !!!

       This Release contains all extracted files from this superior The Fall loader so u can have a look for yourself.
