Well, here we are, creeping up on a month after my last NFO of this unsecure
site formly named Sparta and now called X. We know we told everyone you'd only
have to wait for another week for all the rest of the info to come out, but we
wanted to make sure that we captured all the affiliate groups that PRE from this
site. 

<&X> vr0000m.1-xs.com:46449
<&X> wazza.xftp.info:+13773

It is in your best interest to actually read all of this, as it contains some pretty
good information... did we mention, Slave IPs? :) (thanks RFS-JAY)

Let us get something off our chests first and foremost. 

Sparta/X staff, Dont threaten people because you're getting NFO'd. You look childish
and very immature. You're already the most insecure site on the net, if you really
wanna go for 3 out of 3, be our guest... but keep your fucking mouth shut. Last time
you little girls ran around thinking you knew everything about who did what.. but
the fact of the matter is, you know absolutely nothing.. kind of ironic b/c you
clearly know nothing about security, either. Haha, see what we did there? Anyway. This
time around, shut your fucking site down, close your paypal account out and disappear
from the scene. Just fucking quit. Aren't you getting tired of changing your DNS all
thet time? JiMBO aren't you tired of tracking down your payers, begging them to continue
to support your site, when infact all they want to do is get away from you guys.

Now, lets cover the little bit of the mechanics of the scripts we wrote to gather all the
nicknames, usernames and affil groups that pre from this site.. Pretty secure site right?
Probably not... Like we said earlier, just fucking stop, Sparta/X.


on *:TEXT:*:#X-CHAT,#X-PRE:{
  if ($readini(sparta.ini,n,ChatNicks,$nick) == $null) { writeini -n sparta.ini ChatNicks $nick 1 | return }
}
on *:TEXT:*:#X,#X-FR,#X-NORDIC,#X-SPAM:{
  if ($regex(RaceNicks,$strip($1-),/\(- \d{1,2} -\) (.*) \((.*)\)/i) > 0) {
    if ($readini(sparta.ini,n,RaceNicks,$regml(RaceNicks,1)) == $null) { writeini -n sparta.ini RaceNicks $regml(RaceNicks,1) 1 | return }
  }
  if ($regex($strip($1-),/(GODSEND in (.*) -> (.*) size)/Si) > 0) {
    var %group $gettok($regml(3),-1,45)
    if ($readini(sparta.ini,n,Affils,%group) == $null) { writeini -n sparta.ini Affils %group 1 | return }
  }
}

Guess you're probably wondering what the results of this little script was.. Well, here
you go. We'll start by listing the affils first, since they look the dumbest.

As you can see, well, as long as your not missing a brain.. You can see that our gathering
script worked out pretty well for us. No, we're not going to pretty it up.

One thing we are going to do now, is discuss slave IPs.. If you're a siteop get your head
out of your ass and firewall inbound and outbound connections to the following IP addresses:

95.211.88.21
95.211.88.22
95.211.88.23
95.211.88.24
95.211.88.25
95.211.88.26
95.211.88.27
95.211.88.28

We're is all the proof that you guys are claiming you have? Eh, its right here. Lets discuss
the screen shots so that we're all crystal fucking clear about whats actually going on here.

95.211.88.21.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS1" being bound to IP 95.211.88.21
95.211.88.22.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS2" being bound to IP 95.211.88.22
95.211.88.23.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS3" being bound to IP 95.211.88.23
95.211.88.24.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS4" being bound to IP 95.211.88.24
95.211.88.25.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS5" being bound to IP 95.211.88.25
95.211.88.26.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS6" being bound to IP 95.211.88.26
95.211.88.27.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS7" being bound to IP 95.211.88.27
95.211.88.28.jpg --> Proof of slave "XS8" being bound to IP 95.211.88.28

email1.jpg --> One of the renewal emails we got from them letting us know our next payment was due.
email2.jpg --> Email we recieved after we NFO'd them the last time, to make us aware of the new BNC.
--
rootdir1.jpg --> Main directory listing of the site.. this place is huge.. and we let them get away with it.
rootdir2.jpg --> So many directories we had to take a second screen shot.

Screen shots from our previous NFO are included. We're too lazy to screen shot the same IRC channels
over and over and over again. Its pointless. 

Here is your proof. Get rid of this site. Firewall these IPs.

Enjoy.
