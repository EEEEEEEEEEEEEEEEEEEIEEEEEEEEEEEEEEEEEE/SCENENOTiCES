-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It Came to our Attention that the new Drftpd tech from a .SE ring didn't do his 
job very good.

He Fucked up the Drftpd configs so Fucking bad that his only Option was to leave 
the Ring.

And He did that with alot of Sparkles ....He killed The Master and Deleted the 
Used DB and Config Files.

He Changed root passwords and Took Some Slaves With him.

Kicking Out SiteOps was great To.

We Can't tell you guys enough..Don't Let XeRo- or Any Other Bad-Ass Lamo run 
your Drftpd ring or whatever ring You run.

XeRo- had a choice ..Step out Peacefully Or do it Like we Got to Know Him.

XeRo- Thnx for your Help...And We Hope you Get The Boot On all the Sites you Are 
On....If any left At All...

XeRo- is Dutch And This Is the Rest:

*@*.eo1.fl.home.nl
*@212.120.80.* <-- we Won't Give Away the Compleet IP...Not Needed IMO.
He uses Bnc's For Mirc so Why Bother To Put in his Whois....

We Are NOT asking For A Scene Ban.. We Just State This Info For You To Judge.

We Don't NEED People like XeRo-, we are doing Fine Without Them...

Thanx For your Attention And Keep up the Good work.
Greets To TheDamned And TheRealGuy.
