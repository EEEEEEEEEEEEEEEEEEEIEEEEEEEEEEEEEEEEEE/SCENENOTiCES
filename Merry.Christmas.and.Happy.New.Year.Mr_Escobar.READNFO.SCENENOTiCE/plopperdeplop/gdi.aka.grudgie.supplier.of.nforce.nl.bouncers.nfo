Please make note of the following:
GDI aka grudgie aka _|GDI| on efnet/linknet (and who knows what other net) is the main supplier of a range of bouncers who run in the RIPE registered NFOrce.nl range.

-------------------------------------------------------
_|GDI| is n0b0dy@rookt.wiet.want.hetbierisop.nl * c
_|GDI| using efnet.xs4all.nl follow the white rabbit!
_|GDI| actually using host 85.17.52.157
_|GDI| End of /WHOIS list.
-------------------------------------------------------

A simple WHOIS lookup for the ip 85.17.52.157 returns 
inetnum:        85.17.52.0 - 85.17.52.255
netname:        NFORCE
descr:          NFOrce
descr:          Netherlands
descr:          http://www.nforce.nl

www.nforce.nl is bound to IP 85.17.52.239

I came across this when he offered me a bouncer himself, running on christina.nforce.nl:2500

# telnet christina.nforce.nl 2500
Trying 85.17.40.216...
Connected to christina.nforce.nl.

:Welcome!psyBNC@lam3rz.de NOTICE * :psyBNC2.3.1

85.17.40.216 is bound to another NFOrce.nl range (http://www.iptools.com/dnstools.php?tool=ipwhois&user_data=85.17.40.216&submit=Go)

Siteops,
Do I have to make this any more clearer that a person who HAS ACCESS to the nforce.nl domain and SUPPLIES bouncers (and probably sniffs/logs the traffic from the users who use this) DOES NOT BELONG IN THE SCENE??

Please take the appropriate actions against this unsecure public scene guy and delpurge him now.

- For the sake of scene security
