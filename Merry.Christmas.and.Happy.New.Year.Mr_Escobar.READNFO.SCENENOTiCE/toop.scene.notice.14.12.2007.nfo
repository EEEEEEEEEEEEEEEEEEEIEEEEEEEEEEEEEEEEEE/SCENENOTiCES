Merry.Christmas.and.Happy.New.Year.Mr_Escobar.READNFO.SCENENOTiCE
(Mr_Escobar / Danny / gatecrash / alkaline)

14th December 2007.

Here is some of my own true talk about this shitty made SCENE-NOTiCE:
Merry.Christmas.SLiGA.and.Friends_You.Are.Exposed.Again.READNFO-SCENENOTiCE

This one is made buy some CraZy guy with alot of names and he is also running a site
and maybe a owner or have a good releationship with some of the PRE-Bot networks.
Mr_Escobar, Danny, gatecrash, Alkaline or what the fuck his name is today on iRC or FTP!
And alot of the things he want to PROOF is FALSE and the SCENENOTiCE he made
is with alot of FAULT inside.

Toop:
Fist off all i can tell your guys out there, I`am NOT a P2P user and has never been that.
Where is the P2P stuff on the private dump site, he was showing in the takedown!

I was staying at the Scene really unknown for about 2-3 year, because i was donator of Hardware/HDD.
Until i was Started the SLiGA DK Team. Then i think some DK TV Teams get mad about SLiGA and me.
I think the Scene is to Small for more new DK TV Teams, so maybe this gatecrash/Mr_Escobar is
in some DK Teams or a good friend of some of them since he want SLiGA and me OUT.

WHY is the Scene and DK Teams not talking on the good way together, That will make the DK scene
more strong and we will see more DK Releases not only a few.

It Could be nice to get all the best from DK TV in the scene everyday.
but again some people dont want or like new DK TV teams so thats why he spread news about we are P2P.

Yes, I was starting SliGA when i dont get more SAS.Liga matches from the other teams.
and i needed all the Football stuff i could get for my job down here.

The DanTV releases that he found on monsun was from months ago before they get Scene banned.
so what the fuck. i think some sites with Archive still have some off them online.
so this still dont get me to be a P2P man.

-
Monsun, has never been a SITE, only a private dump site for some friends.
Monsun, has never ever got a PRE ADD bot ! (how could DanTV affil and PRE there without ADDPRE bot.)
Monsun, has releases from all over the scene. and NO P2P shitty stuff.
Monsun, he forget to show some RACE iNFO from some of the OPs from some big sites,
but maybe he dont want it out, because of the people he know very well, they will get very angry !

He only show the race info for the people he want KICK from the Scene.
He only try to get me KICKED because i was looing for SAS.liga matches on the
#PRE network he was at. (i think its near 3 months ago now.) SO TAKE CARE WHAT YOU SEARCH FOR TEHRE !
and he is not showing all the other search i made on that #PRE network.
because he only want to show your "people" that i am a menber of DanTV.
BUT i was not a member of DanTv. and to show that i can tell you all that im living in Thailand
now for many years and have a Thai IP. and what site have my IP showing that i was in DanTV.

I could show some PROOF (log & screenshot) here with some known Scene names,
but i am not that kind of guy, making problem for other nice and cool friends on the scene.

FROM THE SCENENOTiCE:
"Here’s some more evidence:
Forbrydelsen.S02E01.DANiSH.WS.PDTV.XviD-DanTV - 72d 11h 46m 46s
DanTV is exposed as p2p, finally quits and then just EIGHT days after DanTV stops preing a new 
Danish TV group called SLiGA pop up. Let’s go back and see what their first pres were:
Sas.Liga.30.09.07.FCM-AGF.DANiSH.PDTV.XViD-SLiGA - 64d 18h 35m 49s
Sas.Liga.30.09.07.FCM-AGF.DANiSH.PDTV.XViD.REPACK-SLiGA - 64d 17h 29m 12s 
If you guys search your predbs you will see that the only other group to ever release a cap of the 
tv show Sas.Liga was DanTV. Also, did no one else find it strange that these –SLiGA people 
were complete unknowns and not on any normal sites? "

Toop:
YES, SLiGA started 8 days after DanTV get banned. agian i can tell you we only PREd SAS.LIGA football, 
its not what DanTV RLS. and it was started because i NEEDED all the Football matches i could get.

about other nick´s in his NFO.

psxman.
That guy i have been knowing since i was born. He is NOT a P2P user as he tell all of you in 
the NFO. he is a nice guy with no access to something until we started SLiGA, and again folks
LOOK at the the NFO and TAKEDOWN from his crazy Scene.Notice WHERE is all the uploads from psxman ?
or Downunder as he also call him and its a FAULT more in the Notice. Downunder is a botname i try make.
not a FTP login ! but there is no UPLOAD from psxman inside because he dont have acccess to RACE some
stuff on the FTP and are not USING P2P as he state he do, AGAIN its a LIE from the people behind that
SceneNotice. And he has never been the old psxman from 4-5 years back. so again his info is WRONG.
where is that PROOF ? (everybody can say you are P2P user, you are that person from old time).


noodlz.
That guy i have only known him for a short time, but its a nice person and NOT in DanTV.
but have a team yes called ETACH, and he live far away from DK and has nothing to do with
the DK TV Scene. but I made a BIG BIG MISTAKE on my private dump Monsun to make a group name called
@DanTV as all people can see in the TakeDown. i should have making him @iND.
I was only Making this @DanTV on that private dump because he have som SAS.liga matches from DanTV
that i dont have so i called him with that grp. name. I cant run from that. and i never want to do that.

crock.
That guy i have only know him for a short time, but also him is a nice person and was not sure about him,
about he was in DanTV or not. now more and more people talk to me and some of my other friends about
he is a old member of DanTV, hes was a short time in SLiGA thats true. but was leaving when all the
rumours came up.

The other users.
They was only dumping a little bit and now they are known as P2P, LAME because again its not the true.


To the siteops:
I never have DanTV as affils (I never had a PRE ADD bot)(never have some other affils)
I has never ever been using P2P, and you dont find any info on me and my IPs on P2P network
and you dont see any PROOF for that in the SCENENOTiCE.
I understand you have to DELUSER me and SLiGA because of this LAME made SCENENOTiCE.


BUT ALL ABOUT THIS is AGAIN only because of DanTV and thats 3-4 months OLD shit.
and try understand DanTV and the people behind is gone, i see in some .nfo that
the Danish TV grps. are using the same shit everytime a new team start, sucking out that they are
DanTV , Thorzen, Gohre or what the name was in DanTV.
So please STOP that or the Danish TV Scene will die. and start wake up and get some new DK Teams in,
for make more and more good releases to all the sceners. (i cant see why Mr_Escobar) dont want
new DK TV Teams in the scene.


SLiGA is and was:
Toop
psxman
..... (no name because he is out and not known in any nfo)

crock (DELUSER) when he start knowing the problems. and he was not in SLiGA from the beginning,
      only for 1-2 weeks before the SCENENOTiCE came out about SLiGA and friends.


AND Mr_Escobar i am the wrong guy you think about.
SO STOP MAKE SCENENOTiCE OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT, BUT ONLY WANT KICK.
I realise now that i should have been staying as "Toop" on all my sites and never have touched the TV DK scene.
With a new DK team called SLiGA.
Sorry friends !

Merry Christmas Mr_Escobar and Friends, Take care in the new year.
now its up to the site owner/ops about i can stay as Toop or not anymore, but im a honest true person.
RiP SLiGA, 2007 :-)
