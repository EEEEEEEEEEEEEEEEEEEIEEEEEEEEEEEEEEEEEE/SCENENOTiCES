Farewell.And.Godbye-SVENNE-REDCROSS

After ten years on the Scene we're stepping down and leaving it forever. We
have been exposed by the Swedish Antipiracy Bureau whom have identified all
of our members and sites. The good thing is that we have had the possibility
to make a settlement.

Our activity is immediately ceased.

We apologies to all Swedish and foreign movie producers for the damage we
have caused.
Those of you who are still involved in the Scene - close down. None of you
are safe out there.
