enjoy your easter holiday u fuckheads ;)

got some info about an grp called AnKa, EPK, RZB that releases 
stuff on the scene and yes they upload stuff trough p2p as well..

they upload their releases on swebits.org and who knows where else!?

nicks used on irc: xaptos and echonomix

echonomix is using ip: *@213.67.77.125, *@213.67.77.* *@213.67.77.20
he uploads stuff through swebits.org with the nick "rasputin", 
does the nick look familiar to ya? maybe because he likes to steal 
nicks from real sceners and a friend of my actually!

xaptos is using ip: thastrom@81.235.241.231

u want proof!? just look at the pics..................

deluser these fuckers if u want no trouble

we want the scene to be as secure as possible and all p2p ppl that 
read this can fuckoff and see this as a warning because u are next!

until next time we say over n out for now
