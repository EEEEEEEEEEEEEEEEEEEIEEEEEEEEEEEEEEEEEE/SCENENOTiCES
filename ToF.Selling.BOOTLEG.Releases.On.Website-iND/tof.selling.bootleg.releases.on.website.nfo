	It is brought to my attention that when you download ToF's release of Hostel.SVCD.CAM.READ.NFO-ToF at the 18:06 minute mark of CD1 you will find a bright green watermark of a website address of www.xp38.com. When you goto this url you get redirected to a url that clearly is selling bootleg retails of movies/xbox/ps2 etc.  I have included a .jpg of the exact url add popping up within their release of Hostel.

	If you are on a site that AFFIL this group plz make siteops/admins known of this issue ASAP.  It is groups like this that make it impossible to share other releases without getting the attraction of Law Enforcement Agencies all over your ass.
