1. "rented.sites.and.rented.GROUPS"
Groups?
a. What the f is a rented group?
b. How exactly did you checked that, genious?
c. Any proof?


2. "According to me those groups are "sites whores" and REALLY not SECURE"
Poor, fella, you obviosly don't know much, do you? We, for one, were on 2 listed sites, we had ONE ratio account on each. R-A-T-I-O. Do you really think that was site whoring? Do you really think that we were on those 2 for anything, except for simple preing?


You know what the problem is with this approach, fella? You took a few site names, pasted their details and affils into a text file and put a scandalous name on that thing. And the problem with that: you mixed good groups that never did anything wrong with groups that we all know are fucked up. This is like calling every black person a country boy, or calling every white guy a racist. You took a bunch of info, put it all into one pot, and showed ZERO proof. Nothing but a bunch of scandalous bs. Fuckin yellow press, that's what that is.

People, think for yourself for christ sakes!



P.S. Much love for all the siteops that have enough integrity to think and decide for themselves. And for those people who think that nothing is valid unless it's been proven.
