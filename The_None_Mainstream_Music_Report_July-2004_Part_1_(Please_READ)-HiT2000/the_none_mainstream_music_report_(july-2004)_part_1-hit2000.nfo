Welcome to HiT2k's new biweekly non-mainstream music report!
Heavy love to the scene, no hate, and extra props for those taking the
time to read here.
   
To start off: this is not a 'hater' magazine, and we aren't trying to
insult or bring anyone down with it.
our aim is pure and easy: to bring the scene's attention back to the music!
All here at HiT2k are lovers of music, with no politics or dramatic baggage.
We just want to share the love!
   
That is why, every 2 weeks, we'll compile a list of the best non-mainstream
records released in the scene, and give you all the info you need to decide
whether or not you want to hear them.  We do this because, each day, records
slip under the radar because people may not know the name on the album --
but that doesn't mean they wouldn't love the music inside.
We feel it's time for 'our' music -- non-mainstream, underground, whatever
you want to call it -- to push forward and be heard by more ears around the world.
We hope this report can turn you on to things you may not have found otherwise,
and perhaps cause some people to expand their opinions of what they call 'music.'
It is important we stress, however, that we won't always be able to list all 
of the scene's great releases each week.  Because of this, we call on other
dedicated groups to start their own reports, magazines, etc.  
There are hundreds of albums released each day, but so little information provided!
More information distributed means more knowledge, and more knowledge means smarter,
better-educated listeners.
   
And even though we don't get to say it enough in the nfo's: support the artists!!
It goes without saying that these are not millionaire pop stars, and they need to
sell records in order to be able to create more of them.
With all that said, please, enjoy the report. :)

A list of our suggested releases July 1-20, 2004:

Release Name: Jack_Rose--Raag_Manifestos-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-01
Label Info and Catalog #: VHF Records #85

Artist/Album Info:

    "Compiled from a variety of sources, Raag Manifestos cuts
     across various acoustic styles much like Rose's Opium Musick
     LP, but with a more aggressive attack. 'Black Pearls from the
     River' and 'Hart Crane's Old Boyfriends' are dense, serious
     assaults on the 12-string, with the intensity of the latter
     enhanced by Ian Nagoski's roaring electronic backdrop. With
     subtle tabla accompaniment by Eric Carbonara, 'Crossing The
     Great Waters,' is another epic modal journey in the style of
     Pelt's 'Road To Catawba' and Rose's own 'Red Horse.' The
     traditional 'Blessed Be the Name of the Lord' finishes off the
     CD on a calming note. In mini-gatefold." Limited edition. Vinyl
     pressing of this on Eclipse due out this summer.

Release Name: Clogs--Thoms_Night_Out-2001-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-11
Label Info and Catalog #: Brassland (HWY-002)

Artist/Album Info:

     Clogs are four classical musicians from Australia and the US.
     Their chief composer, Padma Newsome (viola/violin), was born in
     the red center of Australia, the son of a writer and an
     ecologist. In the early '80s he trained and performed as a
     concert violist in Sydney. He retired early, however, spending
     the next six years on an ashram in the remote region of New
     South Wales. Newsome began composing in the '90s at the
     University of Adelaide, and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship
     to study at the world renowned Yale School of Music. There he
     met Bryce Dessner (guitar/composer/The National), Rachael
     Elliott (bassoon), and Thomas Kozumplik (percussion), who round
     out the quartet.
     Thom's Night Out met with unanimous critical accolades when it
     was released in the United States in 2001, garnering
     comparisons to artists as diverse as Arvo Part, Sigur Ros, and
     Godspeed You Black Emperor! The Wire celebrated its' "eerie,
     looping folk melodies...delicately bowed and struck strings
     [and] beautiful 'lost at sea' effect." Careless Talk Costs
     Lives said, "What d'ya call yr contemporary classical outfit
     with pretensions to be Satie, Stravinsky, Sigur Ros, and a more
     approachable Godspeed? Clogs. Sweet." The New Yorker: "fans of
     the Rachel's, and other post-rock ensembles who know how to
     listen in respectful silence to a live performance will have no
     trouble appreciating the softly evocative compositions."
     Philadelphia City Paper wrote that "few new CDs in any genre
     will do as much to challenge the way you listen to music."

Release Name: Wildflowers--The_Complete_New_York_Loft_Jazz_Sessions-3CD-1976-HiT2000 
Release Date: 2004-07-18
Label Info and Catalog #: Knitting Factory #3037

Artist/Album Info:


     Originally released as five separate albums under the title
     Wildflowers: The New York Loft Sessions on Casablanca records
     in 1976, this single disc compilation contains ten tracks from
     those monumental sessions reissued by Knit Classics. Recorded
     May 14 through 23, 1976, at Sam Rivers' studio/loft/home
     Rivbea, featuring a collective of free jazz players who were
     having a hard time getting paying gigs. The entire disc is
     highlighted by a roster of legends including Hamiet Bluiett,
     Dave Burrell, Kalaparusha Maurice McIntyre, Sunny Murray, Randy
     Weston, Byard Lancaster, David Murray, Anthony Braxton, Julius
     Hemphill, and Ken Mcintyre. Listening to these recordings years
     after their initial release proves that while these musicians
     were certainly experimental, they were also obviously steeped
     in musical traditions like blues and gospel, which was lost on
     a jazz public turned off by their flashes of unhinged energy.

Release Name: Locus_Solus--50th_Birthday_Celebration_Volume_3-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-12
Label Info and Catalog #: Tzadik, #5003

Artist/Album Info:

     Continuing Tzadik's series of live recordings from Zorn's 50th
     birthday month is this classic reunion of three downtown legends,
     Arto Lindsay (Ambitious Lovers), Anton Fier (Golden Palominos)
     and John Zorn (Naked City). There has never been a band quite
     like Locus Solus. Dating back to 1982, the music of these
     improvised rock units is still as fresh as the day they first
     hit, and seems to get better with age. This high intensity set
     features all three players at their very best. Strangled vocals,
     loping grooves and structural complexity make these improvised
     rock songs a continual delight. A fascinating and charming set
     of tension, love, ideas, communication and miscommunication.
     Arto Lindsay: voice, guitar 
     John Zorn: alto saxophone 
     Anton Fier: drums

________________________________________________________________________________

Release Name: Luc_Ferrari--Cellule_75-1998-HiT2000 
Release Date: 2004-07-13
Label Info and Catalog #: Tzadik, #7033

Artist/Album Info:

     Luc Ferrari is one of the most important and original personalities
     in the history of French "musique concrete." Irreverent,
     psychosexual and always fascinating, Ferrari's work manifests
     itself in texts, instrumental textures, electroacoustic
     compositions, reportings, films, theater, etc. It is an honor for
     Tzadik to release two of his most important works from the 1970's,
     recorded under the supervision of the composer himself. Place des
     Abbesses, the first electro acoustic work realized at his home
     studio in Paris, 1977, is an evocative portrait of a small square
     between The Sacred Heart of God and Saints and the Pigalle of
     licentiousness and sex, two familiar Ferrari obsessions. Cellule
     75 is an explosive, dynamic work for piano, percussion and tape,
     balancing improvisational spontaneity with the more exact writing
     of classical forms. The first U.S. release of this important
     composer.
     Luc Ferrari: composer 
     Chris Brown: piano 
     William Winant: percussion

Release Name: Marissa_Nadler--Ballads_Of_Living_and_Dying-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-19 
Label Info and Catalog #: self-released

Artist/Album Info:

     Velvet voiced ambient murder ballads and goergeous sensitive
     finger-style, drone psychedelia, ethereal reverberations,
     gorgeous music; Leonard Cohen as a sexy voiced female,
     reincarnated with the spirit of a medieval lute player.
     "Marissa's voice soars like the choir invisible," writes one
     reviewer. Songwriting that is dark and haunting, sensitive and
     gripping, telling stories of tragic murders and sordid love
     affairs gone awry. A truly unique blend of psychedelic folk,
     ambient drone, traditional, and european old time haunts.
     Wearing long black dresses, the mournful, almost theatrical
     performances are sexy and hypnotizing. Playing the ukelele,
     banjo, harp, twelve string and six string guitars, and organ,
     the result is fascinating and moving. Dark, mysterious, and
     captivating.
     Psych Van Hett Acid Folk Review (5/5 Stars):
     So where are the labels now to release this ? Marissa's voice
     reminded me at first a bit of Elizabeth Rapp, who didn't appear
     on many songs of Tom Rapp's group Pearls Before Swine (back at
     the end of the 60's, early 70's), but what Marissa has created
     in mood is vivid here as well, be it in a more melancholic way.
     The arrangements are sparse and to the essence completely
     interwoven with the songs (guitar, accordion, amplified guitar,
     organ, banjo, ...) Each of these songs have a variety of very
     dark thoughts combined with gentle pure loveliness and absolute
     care. It is hard for me to go deeper into the songtexts,
     because who knows I can hardly experience the total depth of
     it. And it shows deeper waters of experiences. Her
     interpretation of "Annabelle Lee" on words of Edgar Allan Poe
     is simply brilliant. Other favourites are "Fifty Five falls,"
     (I'll be your..) "Undertaker", and "Days of Rum" with banjo.
     The bonus track, simply humming and guitar I like a lot as
     well: pure melancholic romance!! I lack the  words. A release I
     simply can not help  but listen to again and again.  --Gerald
     Van Waes

Label Info and Catalog #: Graveface Records #010

Artist/Album Info:

     This is latest album on Graveface Records
     Dreamend hails from Chicago and has been compared to
     established post-rock acts such as Godspeed You Black Emperor!
     and Explosions in the Sky.  This is their first full-length
     album which beautifully contrasts wall-of-noise rock with
     blissful shoegazery melodies.

Release Name: Six_Organs_Of_Admittance--For_Octavio_Paz-Reissue-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-10
Label Info and Catalog #: Holy Mountain 21852

Artist/Album Info:

     Since the release of Six Organs of Admittance's self-titled
     debut in 1998, Ben Chasny has played pure guitar within
     individual songs, but For Octavio Paz is his first full record
     to explore the guitar inside and out, solo and over-dubbed,
     steel and nylon string (in fact, For Octavio Paz is the first
     Six Organs album to feature the reverberations of a nylon
     string guitar). What really sets Chasny apart from the other
     modern Fahey worshipers is that Chasny's pantheon is willing to
     accept a wider array of other guitarists into the lexicon -
     Peter Walker or Richard Youngs, for example - not to mention
     the fact that he can stand the sound of a Stratocaster. This is
     the definitive guitar record from Six Organs of Admittance.
     Originally released in a vinyl-only limited edition by Time-Lag
     at the end of 2003, For Octavio Paz sold out instantaneously.
     It was decided that the material is just too strong to belong
     to so few."

Release Name: From_Quagmire--The_Tropic_Of_Barren-2001-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-08 
Label Info and Catalog #: VHF Records #59

Artist/Album Info:

     The Tropic Of Barren is the debut release from Virginia's From
     Quagmire. A trio of Dorothy Geller, James Wolf, and Rake
     guitarist Vincent Van Go-Gogh, FQ's beautiful, mysterious and
     just plain weird art-song drift is a look into a rather
     under-explored corner of the underground universe. The slowly
     unfolding songs are based on Dorothy?s nylon string guitar and
     hushed-but-pointed vocals, punctuated by Wolf's expertly sawing
     violin and Van Go-Gogh's unpredictable percussion, electronics
     and guitar interjections. The music is highly detailed and
     performed with significant individual personality, rather than
     the predictable loud-soft-repeat bombast of other contemporary
     "chamber" ensembles. Geller and Wolf have done time in Camera
     Obscura recording artists Laconic Chamber and the Library of
     Congress (not a band). Van Go-Gogh is straight out of DC's
     long-running freakazoid ensemble Rake.

Release Name: Kammerflimmer_Kollektief--Hysteria-Reissue-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-04 
Label Info and Catalog #: quecksilber music QUECK007CD

Artist/Album Info:

     Re-release of the 2001 on payola/EfA E5 released album
     "Hysteria". this long-deleted Kammerflimmer Kollektief classic
     feat. 15min+ of new studio recordings. An assemblage of
     intriguing electro/acoustic elements, Hysteria is the newest
     offering from Karlsruhe's Kammerflimmer Kollektief.
     Incorporating samples, analog synths, and a plethora of
     stringed instruments (including an acoustic jazz ensemble),
     Hysteria taunts the fine line of control between abstraction
     and realism, with a beauty that's stunning at times.
     Kammerflimmer Kollektief began as the one-man experimental
     excursions of Thomas Weber. Trapping ambient noise, live and
     synthetic drums, guitars, strings, upright bass and keyboards
     into interlocking rhythmic explosions, Weber expanded the group
     to a live six piece in 1999 and has been brilliant and busy
     ever since. From their Karlsruhe, Germany home base, this
     ensemble effortlessly blends experimental electronic elements
     and moody free-form jazz to stunning effect.
     Dietrich Foth - saxophone
     Johannes Frisch - double bass
     Michael StrКder - drums & percussion
     Anne Vortisch - synthesizer
     Thomas Weber - guitar, harmonium, treatments
     Heike Wendelin - violin

Release Name: Islaja--Meritie-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-01
Label Info and Catalog #: Fonal (FR-32)

Artist/Album Info:

     Islaja might well be a forgotten islet somewehere or a name of
     courageous sword swinging heroine in a forgotten fable. For
     one, Islaja is a certain young woman that has sang and played
     an album full of heart-rending intimate music. Half a year of
     quietly working in her homestudio brought about a cluster of
     transcendental tunes that are now being released as an album
     called Meritie.
     One song Islaja whispered in a fever and another with an
     oriental monkey. At times it is impossible to tell where the
     sounds are coming from. The variety of instruments is vast, but
     all have their space and strong belief in the power of
     individual sounds can be heard. Islaja has exceptional sense of
     harmony that alone can make the album a magical listening
     experience.
     The voice of Islaja sounds bravely over the screaming crazed
     sea-gulls. It is stunningly honest. This is a great victory in
     these times of sadness.

Label Info and Catalog #: 

Artist/Album Info:

British alto/soprano saxophonist Jon Lloyd rose to become a notable free improviser
during the '90s, able to balance high-energy blowing with more subtly nuanced 
playing; he was also a capable composer, largely in the free-bop mode, able to 
give his pieces a definite structure while leaving plenty of room for improvisation.

Release Date: 2004-07-17
Label Info and Catalog #: Textile Records TXTVNL01 

Artist/Album Info:

Bill wells meets lol coxhill textile vinyle serie 01 
Bill Wells's Falkirk-based Octet are undoubtedly the greatest big band 
currently in the Uk, although due to the logistics involved, records evidence is 
thin on the ground. So this is a real thrill, the first new Octet material in years, 
fronted by the legendary UK saxophonist Lol Coxhill. Coxhill has played with 
everyone from Evan Parker to The damned and his sopreno sound is instantly 
recognizable, xhether he's squeezing in the sublest nuances from a weepy 
ballad or raising the roof with tongues of hire. 
He's rarely sounded quite as possessed as he does here, pouring big metallic 
sheets of breath all over Well's raucous arrangements. The bizarre loops and 
jagged use of samples gives the whole set a lop-sided feel, like a weird cartoon 
that's fallen slightly out of synch and the opening Sticky Parade sounds invigoratingly 
like Tom and Jerry as scored by Thelonious Monk.

Release Name: A_Hawk_and_A_Hacksaw-A_Hawk_and_A_Hacksaw-2003-BCC
Release Date: 2004-07-07
Label Info and Catalog #: Leaf

Artist/Album Info:

The Leaf label comes up trumps with this hugely charming debut from the oddly
titled A Hawk and a Hacksaw. Imagine, if you will, a cascade of Steve Reichian
looped piano segments intermingling with a veritable menagerie of farmyard 
instruments, accordion, home made percussion, horns, bells and all manner of weird, 
wonderful and hitherto unkown musical toys. The album has a free-flowing, glowing 
world-cinema soundtrackish vibe and was recorded over the course of 15 months 
in the Loire Valley with a variety of guest performers. If you're into Yan Tiersen, 
Tom Waits, Kurt Weill, Asa-Chang & Junray, Captain Beefheart, Raymond Scott and 
Carl Stalling, you'll love this heartwarming album dearly.

Release Name: Fourcolor-Water_Mirror-(Staartje016)-CD-2004-BEX
Release Date: 2004-07-13
Label Info and Catalog #: Staartje016

Artist/Album Info:

After releasing several stunning albums as a part of the electro-acoustic quartet
Minamo (apestaartje/cubic music) and as 1/2 of the electronica duo Fonica 
(plop/tomlab) this is Keiichi Sugimotos first widely distributed solo release as 
Fourcolor. Focusing predominately on the guitar 'water mirror' blends acoustic 
resonance with subtle precision to create an extremely detailed and restrained 
listening experience. Sugimoto focuses on the smallest of elements using electronics 
to accentuate every facit of an already tactile sound pallete. Sugimoto seamlessly 
blends various threads of kinetic listening in this ever-shifting composition of 
gradual movement. A difficult one to memorize, 'water mirror' is a deceptively 
complex album full of warmth and rigor. The album closes with an epic 25 min 
soundtrack to the film 'Frontire' by Japanese experimental filmmaker Jun Miyazaki 
which will be screening at this years Cannes Film Festival. Extremely gradual music.

Release Date: 2004-07-16
Label Info and Catalog #: OCORA Radio France C560097

of the region. The 12 selections are performed by two different groups; one older 
professional musicians trained in the 1920s (tracks 1-5) and the other younger 
musicians working to keep the tradition of degung alive (tracks 6-12). Recorded

Release Name: Dave_Douglas-Five-1995-JUST
Release Date: 2004-07-18 
Label Info and Catalog #: Soul Note

Artist/Album Info:

Trumpeter Dave Douglas' unusual string group (which also includes violinist 
Mark Feldman, cellist Erik Friedlander, bassist Drew Gross and drummer Michael Sarin) 
is reminiscent in some ways of Ornette Coleman's free-jazz quartet despite not 
playing any of Ornette's originals and having a very different instrumentation. 
All of the musicians function as equals, the interaction is often intuitive, 
and the improvising on eight Douglas originals (including tunes dedicated to 
Steve Lacy, Wayne Shorter, Mark Dresser, Woody Shaw, John Cage and John Zorn), 
Thelonious Monk's "Who Knows," and Rahsaan Roland Kirk's "The Inflated Tear" is 
on a high level. Well worth exploring.

Label Info and Catalog #: mego 071

Artist/Album Info:

     A gentle stylistic morphing from two major figures in the
     global realm of experimental sound and improv.
     Zeena Parkins sits firm as a multi-instrumentalist, composer,
     improviser, well-known as a pioneer of the electric harp, she
     has also extended the language of the acoustic harp with the
     inventive use of unusual playing techniques, preparations, and
     layers of digital and analog processing
     Ikue Mori has long been a stalwart of the New York
     improvisation via the post punk set. Her work has seen her
     evolve from drums to drum machine to laptop - how about that?
     Super. As a result the language she presents is as diverse as
     the wide range of people she has played with.
     Now, these two swinging cats have hooked up too create a
     delicate blend of organic acoustic and digital sources. Walk
     deep in the woods, think far beyond the reaches of our
     immediate environment. A soft mental and physical scenario in
     which to bathe, absorb and (gasp horror!) relax.
     Do it - do it now!

Release Name: Thurston_Moore-My_Cat_Is_an_Alien--From_The_Earth_To_The_Spheres_Vol._1-Vinyl-2004-HiT2000
Release Date: 2004-07-19
Label Info and Catalog #: Opax Records OPX LP1

Artist/Album Info:

     This is the first volume of MCIAA's "From the Earth to the
     Spheres" split LP series, with each volume being limited to 100
     hand-painted copies -- and yr pals at HiT2k have access to
     them. :)  Future volumes will incluse Jackie-O Motherfucker,
     Christina Carter (Charalambides), Jim O'Rourke, Thuja and more!
     (Note: the hiss on Thurston's side appears on the record, and
     is not the fault of yours truly, nor HiT2k. ;))
     "When, in late 1997, Maurizio and Roberto Opalio from Torino,
     Italy, started their musical project My Cat Is An Alien, their
     need for an easy and direct way of releasing stuff which could
     fit their creative urgency led the two brothers to set up a
     label on their own. So, Opax Records started up releasing the
     first MCIAA's recording, a cd-r special edition of 30 copies
     wrapped in electric wires, which was sent to Sonic Youth in NYC
     and immediately thrilled the most influential avant-rock band
     since The Velvet Underground. During the past years SY
     helpfully invited MCIAA several times to perform live at their
     European shows; then in 2002, Thurston Moore released on his
     own Ecstatic Peace label the 3-sided LP 'Landscapes of an
     Electric City/Hypnotic Spaces', MCIAA's international debut,
     followed by a couple of only-vinyl releases on the US labels
     Starlight Furniture Co. and Eclipse Records. Now, after 6 years
     of handmade cd-r editions, Opax Records has entered a new era
     with its first proper official format: a new series of split
     vinyl-lps entitled 'From the Earth to the Spheres.'
     So, who could have opened the series better than Thurston Moore
     himself? Surely, Moore is one of the few musicians in the
     world who needs no introduction at all. But even the most fixed
     fan & collector of his many solo records will be surprised by
     this 21 minute piece called 'American Coffin'; from the
     beginning, with Moore engaged in a free-piano action that
     recalls both Dave Burrell's genius of the legendary 'Echo' LP
     on Jazz Actuel and Stockhausen's textures of his wildest
     masterpieces, the track is interpoled and fragmented by
     splinters of sonic feedbacks, howling guitar and every sort of
     musical collage inserts, all permeated by a cloud of dust and
     debris.  Because of its raw analogical recording, there's a
     good load of tape hiss -- so close to Moore's aesthetics.
     On the other side of the vinyl, MCIAA will project you in the
     realm of the Cosmos. Their music is made of space sounds
     flowing freely in both inner and outer dimensions; sound
     sculptors and audiovisual artists MCIAA base most of their work
     and research on purely improvised compositions, erecting
     minimal textures created essentially by guitar space-drones
     influenced by early American minimalism and the conceptual and
     philosophical modus operandi of avant-pioneers such as John
     Cage and Sun Ra. Here, in the track entitled 'Brilliance in the
     outer space', MCIAA will make you lose your sense of
     gravitational perception completely, with a fully emotional
     vertical take-off that will dash you beyond the limits of
     hyperspace. As the cover abstract shapes of concrete acrylic
     painting mixed with crystals on wood suggest a free gestural
     approach, the music represents a real impressive intro to the
     spirit that moves the whole series: art as uncompromising
     expression of liberty."
