I totally agree with you.
The custom scene is fucked, it's just as bad as the tv scene. Do it fast.
Steal em, remake em, sell em as your own. It's like a bad asian market sometimes...
What I was trying to point out, was the rule that TEAFORTWO always ignore. And that they should be banned, I guess I didn't make that clear enough...

Sure custom groups steal, it's just as bad as www subs, or worse even. So get permission of the source group. That'd make it
a whole lot harder for new,noobish groups to hit the scene with their gay(no I don't mean happy) subbing and translations.

Making own subs, is what makes the custom scene. Any person can download a sub from some divxsite, sync it with source release and rar it again.


Now I'm awaiting an answer from TEAFORTWO, 'cause you oughta have a reason why you keep breaking the rules...
