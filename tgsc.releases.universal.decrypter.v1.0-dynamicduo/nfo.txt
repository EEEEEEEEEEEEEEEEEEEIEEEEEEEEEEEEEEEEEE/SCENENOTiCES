      Hi all,

      perhaps  this  little release will piss a lot of people - we followed
      the discussion on major sites. In this point the scene is split. Some
      people  like  the idea, some people damn it. So belive and opinion is
      not  our  goal  - our goal is to show it's possible. So nobody should
      longer  believe  in  snake oil. The crypter was a nice try, but sorry
      guys  you  don't  know much about crypto - even stressing such mighty
      algorithms like AES with 256-bit keys, the system is bad,cause it has
      (obviously)  major flaws in concept and implementation. So enjoy this
      proof  of concept and dont blame us for doing it - if the scene wants
      to  set up such a system, first the scene should agree about it - and
      if  all  major  groups  speak  and  think  with  one  voice  - a good
      cryptosystem  can be set up and implemented, but then with respect to
      ALL  groups  and  not  to one group deciding who participates and who
      not.  Enough  "ethics"  now,  major  thought is proof of concept - no
      worse  thing  than belive in wrong security - it could be done, so it
      was done and it will be done as long, as it's weak and not global.
