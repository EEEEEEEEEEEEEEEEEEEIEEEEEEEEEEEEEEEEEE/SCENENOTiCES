We recently have heard that two so-called "members of the scene" have been spreading rumors 
about supposely insecure sites. We are speaking about Abyss and K- (a.k.a. Kumo).

So, let's speak about facts, ok guys?

- Abyss: he was from sDA group, a bunch of guys that spreaded scene releases to webs 
(elitedivx.com was sDA when it was open) and P2P (emule) and tried to recruit new members 
by asking in channels of the Irc-Hispano network, asking *in public* things like "anyone 
want to leech warez from our sites by ripping video for us?". Well well abyss... you're 
speaking of secure sites, right? hah! tell that to all the ppl who know about "that guy 
who got into out channel and said publicly if we wanned to rip for an elite private scene!". 
Oh, btw abyss, can you give me an up-to-date pricelist of your warez-cds? please please please, 
i'm elite dude!

- Kumo: Hi kumo, how's zonaxbox.net going? oh! i can't see any Bittorrent link! damn, u erased the? 
or are they in the forum, for registered users... but hey! i still can see "by Kumo" in the front-web! 
wow! you really are a neat-elite-secure-siteop-groupadmin! so, u put your releases in a web, and try 
to tell us wich sites are secure? hell, thats not really nice isn't it?. Oh! by the way, how did you 
see that the siteops that pay for your sites didn't get leechers from outside the scene? sure, you know 
everybody!!! hahaha! u're god!, well, look again in your own site dude, u might find a surprise (or 2... or 3...)

So, 2 did-crap-in-the-past-members of the scene (if we can say that... cause the STILL do it!) are trying 
to tell everyone that several sites are insecure (oh! by the way, K-, don't change the nick, it won't work,
we still remember Kumo...)... We could say "they did crap, so they know their king", but then again, what 
the fuck! what are this guys doing in the scene! speaking about sites they don't know about, without proves, 
and we're supposed to LISTEN? men, dupechecks go down for less, and this 2 lame-o-matics are trying to make 
as much damage as they can, before blowin themselfs up...

Please get some proves, and shut the fuck up before every1 else realizes that you are getting 
the releases of the scene out, and letting shit in...
