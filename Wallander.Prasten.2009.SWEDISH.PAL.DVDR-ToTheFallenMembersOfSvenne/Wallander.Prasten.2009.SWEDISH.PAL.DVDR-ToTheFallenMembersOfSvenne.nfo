Hello Scene.. My Name Is Henrik Ponten.
And im realy sorry for the loss of -Svenne
last week... but hey look what i found in my mail?

earlyer I called the producer of Wallander and he told me 
he will send me a movie or two.. so when i checked my mail
i found the Retail Edition of the new Wallander movie named
Prästen... gues what... its fucking 2 weeks pre retail
i am realy l33t.. so i tought ill tell all of you who tought the
swedish movie scene was about to die that you are WRONG..


Enuff of the bullshit...

Note To mr Ponten and the entire fucking Antipiracy homos..
you can stope a revolutionary but you cant fucking
stop a revolution...

Ok you had some rat in SVENNE who snitched on his friends..
wow way the go.. ppl know who he is and he will be taken care of
dont worry.. 

you had infiltrators before... congratulations... 
what you idiots dont think about is all the money YOU idiots
spend on this is ALOT more than the real movie producers LOOSE..

IF YOU LIKE IT BUY IT! thats how it always been and always will be..
and for the few faggots that dont agree on that, they wouldnt 
bought the movie anyway.. so take your paychecks and send em to the
movie makers and go die... since yhe releasing have ALWAYS existed
even back in the 80s with the amiga and c64´s...

The issue today isnt the release groups.. the issue is the p2p networks 
wich are public... not a closed network... any idiot (look at me)
can get movies pre retail...
and anyone can release anything anywhere... your focus should be on the 
so called "pirats" that is sharing everything with everyone not 
us...

how ever i could go on for hours and writing a book
regarding this issue but im not..

i just want to  send a Great Salut to all
the fallen members of the group named -SVENNE and -REDCROSS
and ALL OTHER groups, sites, etc who been a part of the 
APB with family, witch hunt thats been goin on for some time 
now...


You are Gone But Not Forgoten...
