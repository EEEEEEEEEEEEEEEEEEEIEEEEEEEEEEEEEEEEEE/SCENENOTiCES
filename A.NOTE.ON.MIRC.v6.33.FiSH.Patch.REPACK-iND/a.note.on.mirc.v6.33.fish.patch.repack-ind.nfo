A little note on the repack of the latest fish patch.


Doing cracking and fish in one patch is WRONG, and here's why:
1. Many people have bought mIRC, not least because now it includes an online check (so now it has to be patched for a keygenned serial to work) and they don't want their mIRC cracked. Your patch totally defies the purpose now
2. Original FiSH, done by its original author has NEVER included anything that made it illegal. Your patch DOES make it illegal
(illegality is totally not the point, the point is that patching was/is needed only for FiSH to work, nothing else)
3. Nobody knows how qualified you (the author of this patch) are cracking-wise. So I'd suggest leave cracking to the teams we all know, respect and trust


So next time I'd suggest simply sticking to the original conception: patching JUST to make FiSH work, nothing else. Because that way:
1. Users who bought it are happy, since their mIRC isn't cracked, but only patched for FiSH
2. The original/classical (patching simply to make fish work and only because there is no other way to make it work) FiSH conception still applies
3. Users can use fish patch and then use the crack from a group they know and trust


So what it should be like is this:
1. New mIRC comes out
2. Somebody releases a new FiSH patch and that new mIRC version with crack&keygen is pred
3. People use the FiSH patch AND use either a crack from a scene release OR use a legal number they bought (own)
4. Happy end



Anyhow, I neither want a "war" nor do I judge or anything. I simply think that releasing separate patches for cracking and fishing makes a lot more sense and keeps more people happy, since it gives everyone a choice (unlike an all-in-one solution). So this all is just a few points for you to ponder on.
