well, this was supposed to be rlsd along long time ago
but now i had enough

no, i dont have any logs about that site like any real pro would, i just have this stuff im gonna present:

ive been into some p2p channels to do some research about how much it costs to be in that site (unfortunetly ive 
also been there as affil, till i found out whats going on....)

here is some recent log from a p2p member ive talked to about this leeching:

<s****87> i wud rather pay
<s****87> for a TB
<s****87> on one of the 45TB axx
<*******> yep
<*******> SPARTA u mean
<*******> ?
<s****87> yeah
<s****87> speeds are even better
<s****87> bcz they are leasweb
<s****87> yes it sucks with 500GB right now
<s****87> as darks (OTHER SITE) i wud get unlimited

this message above was by TORRENTLEECH uploader

i knew for a fact that sparta had 45TB from someone else affilated in that site right now, also that p2p channel
is known as people trying to find leeches on SPARTA or on other sites, like TVland who got their nfo lately (and they are still running btw as far as i know)

look at this log, who proves (partly) the connection between SPARTA and SCT:
(this scene member is also a p2p tracker owner)

[00:28] <ME> sites like sparta do give out bad names
[00:28] <ME> he is like
[00:28] <ME> "we are not p2p"
[00:28] <ME> the admin
[00:28] <ME> im like
[00:28] <ME> yeah sure
[00:28] <SCENEMEMBER> sparta sells leech slots
[00:28] <ME> i know
[00:28] <SCENEMEMBER> 45€ for 300gb
[00:29] <ME> we are gonna leave there
[00:29] <ME> since the day we got affil there
[00:29] <ME> sct and other torrent sites gets our stuff way faster
[00:29] <SCENEMEMBER> they are not even fast ;>
[00:29] <SCENEMEMBER> sct owns sparta you idiot
[00:29] <ME> wtf
[00:29] <ME> i didnt knew that
[00:29] <ME> i just thought theyre selling it
[00:30] <SCENEMEMBER> how the fuck do you think they do do under 10 sec pretime on tv stuff pred on sparta
[00:30] <ME> :(
[00:30] <ME> why no one rls nfo about it
[00:30] <ME> or something
[00:31] <SCENEMEMBER> already did, they changed bnc and is running again
[00:31] <SCENEMEMBER> many affils left site when nfo came

as far as i know, SCT as well runs XXX group. by the info i got from this user.

another log:
thats from an uploader p2p channel of some torrent tracker named ChronicTracker (no, i didnt uploaded, i just promised i will :) )

[00:29] <------> [COMPLETE] [TV-XVID] ›› The.Real.Monarch.Of.The.Glen.S01E05.WS.PDTV.XviD-REMAX completed 9 seconds after PRE ·
(used to be colorful, my logs dont copy colors :S)

this ^ is a log from sparta irc channel copied to p2p channels by a pay leecher, (ohhh, so thats why they have +u on all the channels :P )

also copied a part of the site rules:
[05:48] <------> [0.3] BANNED:JustDifferent, AlternativePorn, CockLovers ·

another one by different member in that p2p channel who questiond me about SPARTA, this one is Pisexy uploader:

[00:47] <starbursts> hmm
[00:47] <starbursts> what prices/packages do they have?
[00:47] <ME> prices?
[00:47] <ME> ah
[00:47] <ME> sec
[00:47] <starbursts> and is it as good as sparta?
[00:48] <ME> whats sparta
[00:48] <ME> dont know

---

now, you can believe it, and you can just dont care for it, i got all the info about that site, as well as groups
affilated in there, im no longer in there for along time now, as far as i heard, groups CRiMSON and 2HD used to be there
until they found out that site is rented and p2p, and left it, good job guys, you have my respect

now i advice to all groups, and racers to drop on that site, ofcourse its Rented on Leasaweb, 
its been running for some time now and changing bnc from time to time to not get discoverd.

owners/siteops there are Upper and JiMBO.

this is their ftp as far as my logs shows:
