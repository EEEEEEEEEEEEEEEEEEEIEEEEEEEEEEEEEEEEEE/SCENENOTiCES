Just something that should be looked into maybe.

Well, just a little info for those who think because they saw it they know everything.

First off, I was one of the users on one of those sites. I am safe.

I was in a channel with "griffen" for a few months. In a channel with not many people things

start getting imbedded into your brain like certain vhosts that to some may be a bit funny

and to others may piss them off. Well after watching the movie a few things popped into my head

Gryffin for some reason, the first 2 times the guy said his nick, the voice in the background says

"He works for the FBI." Strange? Well ok, skip to the end where Gryffin is speaking to Drosan.

Notice the nick and vhost were on linknet? Now take a look at the vhost. I knew i saw that somewhere

and it came to me, griffen's vhost was griffen@the.yankees-suck.net ... wow coincidence? Finally,

a simple dns on the hostname will give you the following

[20:37] * Dns resolving the.yankees-suck.net
-
[20:37] * Dns resolved the.yankees-suck.net to 64.62.206.40
-
[20:37] * Dns resolving 64.62.206.40
-
[20:37] * Dns resolved 64.62.206.40 to the.yankees-suck.net
-

hmm

now to arin.net

Hmm, bit strange dont u think? The ip that is binded to that vhost comes back to he.net.

The same place all 4 of those .us sites were busted? I guess we should all maybe think a bit

about that one.


Sad thing is, some of us do have our enemies or rival groups. You do everything u can to beat them

and have some hatred toward them because they are opposition. This goes the same for myself, but the

fact is nobody ever deserves something like this... and to griffen .. go fuck yourself.
