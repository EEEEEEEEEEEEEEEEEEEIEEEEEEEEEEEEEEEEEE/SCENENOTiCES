Ah yes, another scene notice. Well atleast this one will contain something useful. I have obtained "through social engineering" the details of a scenetorrent uploader, this fellow also uses many other private trackers as I have confirmed from conversations with other folks.

This guy likes to go into the irc channels of torrent sites and run his mouth. I obtained his hostmask, the masked version, as well as the bare IP address and proceeded to check it against any of my own sites. My goal was to mate his torrent name to his scene name. The first site I went to was a hit. I then contacted the staff of such said site and compared the log, along with his ip, and wouldnt you know it, he was sitting right in the channel. Identical IP addresses. Not the mask, but the IP itself.

I am not going to tell you to purge this guy, maybe you like torrent sites pulling down the scene. You are free to make your own judgement call. I personally have never spoken a word to this man so take this information any wny you like.
