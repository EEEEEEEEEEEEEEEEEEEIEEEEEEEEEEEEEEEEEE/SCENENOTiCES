So, it seems the leased site scene has never been so active before, EVER.
Here are some sites that are leased and their ip(s) will be handed to their according instances.
This is not a p2p cleanup, but a lame rented lamers cleanup (note that siteops with money and no connections can be a real
"leet" siteop these days). To prevent this their known ip(s) are exposed and handed over to federal institutions and
datacenter operators.
So, here we go :>
