!! WARNING to AFFILS, CURRY, regard TFZ and Scene Security "


It has come to our attention that a Site called "TFZ owned and operated by Wondernet Ops, also double that site
as a portal for Torrents sites support, so if anyone affils with TFZ you are in danger of getting caught up in a FED Trap or Sting, we all know how insecure the Kazza, P2P, XDCC, Torrents Shares are.   If TFZ is a part of it they pose a greater threat to our scene security and should be dropped and ousted from the Scene.


Here is some proof.. login on to irc.wondernet.com and do a chan listing.. your see plenty of Torrents channels on it.. also the ops that run "TFZ channel also send this mass msg to those on there irc network!!!
