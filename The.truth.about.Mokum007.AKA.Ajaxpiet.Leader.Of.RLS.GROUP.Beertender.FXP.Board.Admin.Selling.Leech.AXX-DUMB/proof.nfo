==== SCENENOTICE ====
Hello all, we want to inform you about an idiot that is abusing and raping the scene. 
For proof, we've included a video with whois information, on which you can see that Mokum007 and Ajaxpiet
are one and the same person. Look at the ip's and ident on the after-all network (although after-all scrambles
the first part of ip's to a hashcode, you can see that both the hashes are the same, which means it's the same ip). 
On linknet he uses a different ident, and the ip isn't scrambled, but you can still see that he uses the same nick 
and has the same provider. Although our proof proofs that they are one and the same person, you can also see it from his nicks;
Ajax is a soccerclub from Amsterdam, and Mokum is another popular name for Amsterdam.
Some more information about the nicks he uses;

Note; the .wmv video caused winamp to crash here, but it worked fine in mediaplayer. Otherwise try vlc player or another player.

- Mokum007

This is the nick he uses on sites. He is the leader (or one of the leaders?) of a crapgroup named BEERTENDER, 
which got nuked a lot for releasing crap but they keep unnuking their own releases again.

whois on after-all:                 Mokum007 is ~ajaxpiet@12ed360d.13e0fa6.adsl.wanadoo.nl * Ajaxpiet
whois on linknet:                   Mokum007 is ~mokum007 adsl-dc-3c26c.adsl.wanadoo.nl * Mokum007

the scene all kinds of idiots that shouldn't even know that it exists. He is also on numerous other FXP-boards

This fucker poses a very serious securityrisk for the scene; filling on hacked servers and fxp-boards, 
exposing the scene to noobs and making money from the scene by selling leech on hacked servers. Purge him 
from your sites as he is a big risk for your site and all the users on it!!!!
  
Greets from some guys that want to keep the scene clean and secure!!
