PLS stay on the p2p where you belong. Go and post that shit on some p2p forum where you and your friends meet online.
Now, if you happen not to know about us from the scene and you happen to know us from p2p, then go ahead and try to
raise your ratio to some lame tracker in order to download OUR fine releases. Lame.

What's all that about? Taking a video from AURORA without permission?

Also, what do you mean in the above log? Do you mean that AURORA is a p2p group and that we've downloaded the video from p2p and rip it?
Oh come one, pls, like I told you yesterday we've got more important things to do and spend our time than taking seriously this lame notice.
