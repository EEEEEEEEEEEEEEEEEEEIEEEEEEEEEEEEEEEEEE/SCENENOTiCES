Good day,

Today I'm here to talk about the "so called" spanish scene site PEGASUS.
Inside the spanish scene everyone knew that PEGASUS was selling payleech, there is no way that a 4x 1Gbit x 3TB per bnc was being paid by their admins. Their Owners/members/nuckers/some affils, have no respect and reputation inside our comunity, the problem was that we couldnt prove that, we could only add their bncs to our iptables and try and catch people that were racing to our sites from there.

Since there was no real proof, there was no real way to warn groups and users from outside Spain of the danger they were putting themselves in by being on that site, for the past couple of months, many spanish sites have tried to put limits to transfers and shared users with that site and has been a real success, sometimes even the pretime will go over 10min making the racers skip our rls, but today we will expand that limitation everywhere.

In november there was a rumor, real info btw, that a group called FastScene was preeing in PEGASUS and that their grp admin borr@s was in jail, so that you know, he was caught selling a product that was first spread throught the scene, his famous "All-in-One"(todo en uno) a DVD9 with programs that was worth 9.5K€, you can research further info, google has the answers. Many grps left, but not all as the info didnt reach them all.

Nevertheless, PEGASUS is the source for almost all the iND stuff that comes to the spanish scene, IND thats P2P based.
Not only this,but most of the banned groups inside the spanish scene, either pre or race their rls first there, im talking about grps like FastScene,ERyX, etc... groups that are proven to be p2p material, but that im not gonna prove here right now because it would take me forever to show you all the proof.

So whats this nfo about?? 

Today I present you THE PROOF!!!, it was about time that someone had access to the payleech bnc, I want to thank the person who allowed me to see everything, it was well worth it...
 
1.1-Explanation about pictures attached.

I am presenting you today with four sets of pictures:

Set1: Racers bnc spanish scene, picture taken on thursday, Payleech bnc, picture taken last night
Set2: Racers bnc spanish rls showing zipscript "pegasus complete", payleech bnc showing just the rls
Set3: Racers bncs  -  Payleech bncs
Set4: Some Siteops and FRiENDS that should be kicked from the scene.

Furthermore I present you the list of affils that are in pegasus in case you want to delete them from your boxes, I include captures from the Racers bncs since the payleech bncs have all the users and groups masked.

Hola en especial a mente, como va todo? al final si que vendiais payleech eh pillines, y eso que me juraste y perjuraste q pegasus era un convento... si esque que al final se pilla antes a un mentiroso q a un cojo... joder estaba claro q esto tenia que pasar, era cuestion de tiempo.

Estoy hasta la poya de que muchos luchemos por una scene limpia y me venga gentuza como vosotros a filtrarlo todo al P2P y encima os lucreis, por eso y como no es de recibo que os lucreis con nuestro trabajo saco esto, a ver si os cortan el grifo de una puta vez.

En fin, para los que no sepan leer ingles, q les hemos pillado, que adjunto pruebas, mirad quien esta y baneadlo de vuestro site, poner los bncs del site en vuestro iptable en linux y en vuestro firewall en windows para que no os jodan...

Y ya sabeis, esto no acaba aqui, si alguien tiene info de algun site que se dedica a este tipo de actividades delictivas, no os corteis, TODOS A LA HOGERA!!!

Que empiecen a rodar cabezas!!!!

Mañana mas,

Por una scene mas limpia.
