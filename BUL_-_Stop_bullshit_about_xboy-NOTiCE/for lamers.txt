This text is made for lamers who made up some things about xboy and now think they are l33t !!!!!!

First of all, u aren´t l33t and u will never be l33t in rest of your life... and do u know why ??
Cos u are lying to yourselves and to others by selling some stories to ppl that know xboy from his first days in scene...

1) xboy known as x_ is in scene for almost one year !!!!! So dont show pictures old more then one year, if u know to calculate that is before he entered the scene as trader, and good one from his first days...
2) and what the fuck are u doing on torrent sites when u found that "xboy" old one year  ??? does that means u are on torrents sharing stuff, personally i would be surprised about that.
3) stop be lame and childish cos u will never destroy our spirit


Siteops : do not believe to .nfo that BUL guys wrote, because u know that their group sux and its banned almost on all sites
Before u even delete xboy from your sites, try first talk with someone that knows xboy, or even with him. Its on your turn to decide whether u will trust lame group that cant even make good release or trader that was supporting your site better then rest of your traders...

xboy, u have our support.....
