PTK has taken it far enough. Re-encoding everything from Oink is one thing, 
but preing stuff under another group is taking it a bit too far. 
Siteops who have PTK affiled in some way; just purge them already. 
Apparently the group is run by one guy who feels the need to start shit. 
I think the last line pretty much sums up the fact they need to get out of the scene.

[PTK has 26 releases, 20 nukes (76.92%) and 0 internals (0.00%)]
