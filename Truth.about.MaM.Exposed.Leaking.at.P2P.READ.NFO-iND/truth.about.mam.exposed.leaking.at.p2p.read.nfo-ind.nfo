They are swedish MMA (fighting) release team... creators and administrators of big swedish DC-Hubs that
have 500+ users in Public and 60+ users in Private, wich they use to leak scene releases.

A few weeks ago i heard about some guys leaking a bunch of scene releases to MMA torrent sites, then
i started an investigation about this topic. First of all, the big MMA torrent site address is
http://mma-tracker.no-ip.org. Most of scene releases are uploaded there very quickly after pre time.
How? By whom?

After some check of the site, i realized that the releases came from swe-mma DC-Hub (MaM is running this hub).
They post this comment on most of the scene releases they leak to the site "thanks to swe-mma DC Hub for provide this".
and i also found that they are running a Private Hub for fast spreading of new releases.

The Public Hub address  : swe-mma.zapto.org:411
The Private Hub address : Loiders.hopto.org:1640
IRC channel             : EFNET  #swe-mma (main users had moved to the other chan maybe)
swe-mma board           : http://swe-mma.armbar.se/forums/index.php

When i first found the Hub, i just thought that some scene traders were the ones running this big Hub.
But, after some inquiry i realized that the hub owners [SU] and [OP] are fucking MaM members!

They are racing scene MMA releases to their Hub dump (the dump is 100/100mbit speed and
share 10s lots on the Private Hub for fast spreading); and then the releases are leaked to the Public Hub
and torrent site directly.

Just take a look at the following Nicks and IPs, then you would realize that they are real leakers!
