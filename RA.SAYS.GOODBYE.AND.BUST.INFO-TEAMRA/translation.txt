Yes, our RlsDB, UB and SiteDB was bustet, so make your sites disappear if they were RA-Scanned, the addlines
wont get them anywhere. The Connects were deleted on another server already! They were not on the busted
server, so plz change the bnc´s that were added under your nicks and get the sites down. Cause some real site
ips were added as far as i know. And plz spread this text all around! We from the RA-staff, namely the owners,
nukers and coders are going to keep things low at first! Rumours say that the LKA (Landes kriminalamt = FEDS) didnt
realise that this was the rls-db, they thought that this was one site of the server wich it wasnt. perhaps
they dont notice those things...but plz follow my advice anyways. This was not only a bad hit for RA, but the
complete Scene. So be careful, hide a while and better be safe then sorry :
-Get the sites down !!
-user bnc´s ändern!!
X3* RD* T* C* AK* PL* HR* M* MM* P4* RP* TB* SITERING etc were added. All in all 54 sites. So plz paste this
text to all of your chans and send the .txt to the sites that are still up, and warn your buddies
THE WHOLE RA TEAM IS SAYING BYE!!!!
then the last two lines with timestamps are :
CHANGE THE VHOSTS!!!!!!!!
they were in the DB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
