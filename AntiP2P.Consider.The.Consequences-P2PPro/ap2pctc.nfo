Dear Mr And Mrs AntiP2P



Just wanted you to consider a small fact, before you go on with the small war you've just
started in Sweden. I will not tell you how to win this fight, or even advice you to put
down your weapons. Just hear me out, and then please come to your senses. For your sake, 
if not for ours.



If you stop and think for just a moment what you are doing.

 

1. Releasing usernames and IPs for hundreds of users all over the swedish DirectConnect 
community. A very effective way to ban users from FTP-sites, but also a great way to make
people upset and angry. And as you so polite have put it, "Very important perople in the 
swedish scene is going down".

2. Consider you burn "MrF00k". Leader of a swedish custom swesub-grp. He has got access
to multiple gbit-sites and 100-mbit sites. I can guarantee you (and I think you can imagine this
yourselves too) that whis fellow will not be happy with you, the rat and aspecially not the site
that banned him.

3. The result it that this "MrF00ker" has nothing left to lose. His Scene-career is wasted, and
you've managed to crash his P2P-hub. What he does, and this my son @ 4 years old also realises, 
is getting his revenge. 

4. What if all his logs (mIRC auto-logges almost everything), ftp addresses, usernames of SiteOPs, 
their IPs and all kind of this information PREs in the next *.nfo released on the scene. Or,
imagine, it is sent to Mr Pontén. (If you dont know him, ask a friend)

5. You dont have to be a rocket scientist to realise that this would do you far more harm
than the harm you've caused MrF00k a while back. He lost hit access, are you willing to
go to jail for that?



Please. Just give this scenario a moment. Think about it. This might save the swedish 
scene for another time. Dont fight eachother. The APB does this so good by itself.



*MrF00k is an imaginary nickname. But there might be a guy out there just like him,
with nothing to lose.

Finaly, SPECULATE:

You guys have a point. No dubt about it. The thing you're saying, is that P2P has grown 
to be a better trade-market för piracy releases. A no credz-system, with many highspeed 
connnections will make the releases spread faster than any other protocol. Unfortunately 
for you though.

And to say that traders is helping out the scene. LOL. Sure, they do some good for you 
(being your private bitches, sry for the language).But what exactly are these kind of fellas? 
Just average P2P-users, just steppet up a notch, trying to make it in the major league. 
With ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to contribute, they trade others hard work (so you say) and 
hope to leech themselves. Don't you realise that these dudes will race the releases to 
any ftp-server, anywhere on the planet just to get their credz. 

If you would like to call these traders, and all these 10-mbit sites for scene-folks; be
my guest. I say they are to no more help for the scene than P2P. If you would like to
clean up the whole internet world, go ahead. But concider clean up in your own backyard 
before coming here, messing on my doorstep.

Almost forgot AntiP2P:

Yeah. Try tracing this. Be my guest, follow this bread trace. We're not part of any
busted hub. Would we still be standing tall then. Nah, i think you have overrated you
own ability just i little bit. You will never manage to shut down P2P. Sry to have to break
it to you. It's a fact, that multiple groups out there have members in the busted hubs. What
do their crew do about it? NOTHING! Why? Because P2P is everywhere. Folks don't have time
to watch the screen 24/7 like some of you. P2P is easy. Just que the releases you want,
and watch it download. No credz needed, and always (if you are on a nice hub) great speed.
