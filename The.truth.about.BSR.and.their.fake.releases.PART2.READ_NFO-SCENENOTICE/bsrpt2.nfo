Hello once again people.

seems like those retards from BSR didn't got the notice right, 
we said they faked their releases, yes, they do stole a release for an instance from XDS
and release it as the same DJ but in somewhere else in the world , which is a total fake because
the only thing they  do is rename the release, cut a few secs outta it
and release it as Dj_XXX_-_Live_at_someotherclub-LINE-noobs
Well, it's all true what we said here, you guys are just retards and only can be beaten by the sites who affil you

do us once again a favor, sceneban these retards, they ain't needed, and really ain't needed in the LIVE scene.

greets to all REAL LiVE groups

by the way, seems like someone woke up ;)
