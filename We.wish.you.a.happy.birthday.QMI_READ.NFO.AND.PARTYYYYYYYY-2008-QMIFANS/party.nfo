This one is dedicated to our favorite releasing group QMI!
We LOVE you guys, yes we really do!

For five years now you have been bringing us the finest music
on earth.

And please, promise that you won't resign in the next 50 years!

Without your releases everyday life would be as unpleasant as
sitting on a cactus!

So, again, HAPPY BIRTHDAY and WE LOVE YOU! :-*

Sincerly,
some of your biggest fans
