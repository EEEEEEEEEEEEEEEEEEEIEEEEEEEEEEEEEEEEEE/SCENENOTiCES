I litterally had 2 FBI agents at my door yesterday.
I was playing Halo yesterday when my wife answered the door.
She told me the FBI was at the door for me. I seriously thought she was joking.
Until they showed me their badges and asked me if they could come in to ask me a few questions.
Im still trying to remember everything they said and asked yesterday.
From everything I remember they were not after the torrent side of things. Which is a side of releif in a way. I even mentioned I run/own a torrent tracker and dont even think they included that in their notes. They were more interested in my boxes/servers. They wanted to know what isps I use on my personal servers. As well as what dedicated hosting companies I was using. I gave them pretty much any info they asked for without getting over specific if you catch my drift.
I nuked my site due to the fact that I had mentioned to them about the site. As a safety precaution. I figured if I nuke it before they ask or wanted to check into it then they cant hold me accountable since they never told me to save anything from there. I also figured they know about me. So why include anyone else in the search.

They are very much indeed interested in any info about the following.
Colo Sites
LT BOXES in specific....
Eggdrops
irc chatrooms (& hidden chatrooms)
proxies ect...

They asked me how I pay for all my servers I said from anonymous donations or from people who lease servers through me.
I said I receive most of the money through paypal.
They told me they have NO JURISDICTION over paypal so cant legally go into anyones paypal accounts to obtain information. (If I understood them correctly... Which I beleive I did.)
They asked me for the login info on every server I have. They didnt even know about alot of them... just to give you idea that they are only focused on certain companies.
I told them I use HV and LT They werent too interested in the HV servers. They seemed to only be interested in the LT. They wanted login info... wanted to know who used the servers ect.. I dont have the login info for the LT servers so couldnt really provide them with any info about them other than the fact the servers were registered in my name and I pay the bill for them monthly.
(I doubt they want anything from me other than info to try and catch higher ups. Cause if they really wanted me Im thinking I would have been taken out in handcuffs already yesterday.)
They asked me if they had permission to leave my house with MY computers and any recorded media.. I told them I had burned movies mostly but no they couldnt leave with my good unless they came back with a warrant.
I see no point in deleting and bury my hds. Since they already have good ideas of what was on the hds anyways. They were watching me use the computer for a few minutes. (And I already stated I had movies ect.. in my home anyways)
They also asked if I knew of any scene groups... they gave me a list of known groups and I pointed out the ones I heard of. They asked me if I acctually knew or was affilled with anyone in any of those groups. I told them no...
Once again I think they are just after me for more info but wont know until when/if they decide to come back again. (Which im sure they will be back)
