  Time to expose one of the ScT uploaders, c00kie.

  Just so you know, c00kie has been doing some lame
  "nfos" and upping them into their bittorent site,
  and  saying  things like  we cant  never shutdown
  P2P  and what  ever we do,  he still continues to
  upload.

  c00kie is  also known as Krackel,  mostly he uses
  that  on scene sites. So siteops,  if he has been
  on  your site or IS RIGHT NOW, ITS TIME TO PURGE!

  To  verify this, check the ip's  and other  stuff
  from previous scenenotice (part 3).That contained
  very useful information,so other sceners can also
  pre using OPERATiONSCT, but include our email  so
  people can contact us.It has been helping on this
  situation, people from scenetorrents  (users  and
  also some uploaders) have been contacting us.
  
  Then for the next part, site called BitSoup.org.

  It is a payleech site, which is probably in a ring
  and has been selling access. Site they gave axx
  was 5TB ftp server, and the staff member handling
  that was a guy called REXXZ. More information about
  this later. Also if you have heard something about
  them, please contact us.

  
  As a bonus present, let us also expose some other
  torrent uploaders... These two uploaders belong to
  uk-torrents (uk-t.org)

  First one of the uploaders is named blackbeard. He
  uses the same nick on scene sites (wow, dumpass)
  
  http://uk-t.org/userdetails.php?id=10226
  Class	Maxi Uploader
  Uploaded	1.74 TB	
  Downloaded	107.32 GB
  
  irc: blackbeard [whateva@*.sc.res.rr.com]

  He is a racer at some sites, and is told to be siteop
  at some gay site too. Racers be careful, and look
  what site you are using.

  Another uploader at uk-torrents is Xtech. His
  scene nick is told to be woodslnger. He is also
  told to be taking donations to buy LT boxes, and
  is uploading thought many users (UKTeam, Seederbox1
  and so on). He is on a site which has siteop called
  jak3 or jake on link-net, who used to also do stuff
  for uk-torrent under the name t0ne.
  
  irc: woodslnger [woodslnger@69.26.???.???]
  
  It is suspected that they are uk-torrents only
  uploaders, and whole site will fall down when they're
  taken out.

  So siteops, check your sites. Racers, check who
  you are racing stuff for. Expesially if you affil
  some of these guys!

  Thanks for user at scenetorrents for pointing
  this out.

  Remember, all the current uploaders and people
  who do stuff at P2P. YOU ARE NOT SAFE, YOU ARE
  NOT HIDDEN, EVEN IF YOU THINK SO. YOU WILL BE
  CAUGHT AND BANNED! Just like these guys.
  And be warned, we will send your information
  for law enforcement agents also. Its easy to
  drop some anonymous info for them. You have
  been warned.


  Got any useful information?
