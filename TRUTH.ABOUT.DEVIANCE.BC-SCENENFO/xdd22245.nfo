The truth about depax:

Hi there some info that has happend concerning depax and some bitch that liked to narq him info on linknet irc:



Mr-bull founded mirror was gaining to much power so he wanted to stop them (which worked btw ) through 
exposing the leader ( all the personal info you see is fake btw)
I will not reveal real privat info about mr-bull ( I don't lower myself to narq level like he did) 
Mr-bull also defended himself and his group on nforce.
His nickname : Brother 
just read this link and you will see all the info 
http://www.nforce.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21212

the statusses mr-bull had he never did anything else then supply sites (probably hacked ones in the past too seeing his msn 
log with depax)
Ex-real deviance( only one btw in the new fake deviance) senior member.
Hoodlum/myth : leader
Fake deviance : Leader
Next to that he hacks websites and is a canadian roadbuilder ( atleast was during the holidayweek ) 

MR-BULL is toxic@LinkNet-aec7d833d2.trigger-happy.org * toxic
MR-BULL on @#Buttonclickers 
MR-BULL using irc.netfire.com The Hottest LinkNet Connection
MR-BULL is an SSL Encrypted Client
mr-bull End of /WHOIS list.

his msn is deviance_bull@hotmail.com how secure is that? 

for privacy reasons I edited out depax's fake address ect
I CAN ASSURE YOU I AM NOT DEPAX
He is spending time with his girlfriend now and left the scene for good.
Or well how he calls it the fucked up world that is ruled by people that think 
they are better then the rest.
Also depax stated he never sold anything he leeched ( which he hardly did except some retail dvds 
and sometimes so games) depax also ran a movie stuff group ( format will stay unknown) 

I could now explain the total history of depax or mirror ( and there previous groupnames) but I won't 
thats to much privacy.
I will explain a small bit though.

MiRROR was originally XMAFT (and some other groups before that which will remain unnamed)
just before operation site down they formed an alliance with Vitality. HOODLUM wanted them too but during that time 
HLM had Carbon they wanted XMAFT and Carbon to merge in one group and supply them. 
MiRROR hated some Carbon people ( why would reveal a lot of the past groups) so that deal did not went on. 
During that time HLM had a split and that split formed ViTALiTY. XMAFT came in contact with ViTALiTY and formed a deal which 
worked wonderfull for both groups (mutual respect both sides)

Then Operation Sitedown happend and HLM lost a lot of people ( well myth was 80/90 % of them :P) and HLM asked vitality if they 
would merge back. They had the stupid idea of using the Deviance name ( mr-bull even stated to all the staff that the old deviance 
leaders agreed with it ( which is not true depax told me MYTH people hate the, how they call them fake dev) Fake deviance even uses 
the ea keygen generater and safedisk (easy) tools from them without permission. 
How depax knows all this he was in there mainroom.The coop with deviance lasted for like a few weeks. 
During that time mr-bull was kicked ( later to show it was a way to get rid of MiRROR)
The crack started to happen when deviance had mirror wait to pre games MiRROR had to wait 
for 2 weeks to pre advent rising (depax also told me the advent rising that was bad was done by him as he had gotten 
tired to delay but was supposed to be good but was a perfect proper way) after that all went downway. deviance started 
to blame mirror for all fuck ups they did themself and even starting to order stuff like "you should get that game because 
we expect supplies from you guys" Mirror had no moneysuppliers during that time all was 
bought. Deviance had some lazy suppliers. Anyway after the crack deviance tried to kill mirror by talking b/s to siteops.
a 100 mbit hu from them deleted mirror on rumours that mirror posted on nforce and had a member busted. 
Next to that they suddenly wanted all clones death because it was not scene worthy. 
Everyone that knows some mirror/xmaft people know they where very nice people which hardly leeched anything.
MiRROR went separate and had some offers from a few groups to merge. RELOADED and REVENGE asked them and the old MYTH staff wanted 
to join MiRROR to help them all was denied they wanted to be independed.


The msn log we talked about ( I converted the xml file to a txt and edited out the privacy stuff)
