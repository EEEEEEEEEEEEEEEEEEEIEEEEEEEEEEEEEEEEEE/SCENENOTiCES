To the Scene Police "heroes", and not forgetting the "inspirational" -scene documents,

Excellent work. Almost as laughable as BUSTS.AND.FUTURE.OF.THE.SCENE-SCENE. Going into public EFNET channels and running a WHOIS on everyone, when in actual fact the mass majority of these people are acne infested 13 year olds wanting some porn or the latest rap albums. The "real" scene do not hang around in such public domains. Perhaps the ones you do know consider this the status quo, however I am sorry to say that the real scene ditched public channels years ago. Perhaps you should have actually done some research or actually be in the scene to realise.

Therefore, I have one suggestion; fuck off. Do not try and teach us something we know.  Your scene knowledge is akin to saying a 3 year old counting to five can understand calculus. In a way, we are the people who know calculus. You are learning to count. You are both not scene gods, and perhaps BUSTS.AND.FUTURE.OF.THE.SCENE-SCENE may have applied in December 2001, but however, we are now in 2004. I guess both of you were not around since then. It would actually not surprise me if you "sceners" were very public until recently. Every person I know in the "real" scene found both documents the most hillarious and rubbish pieces of work ever.

Now fuck off, you are both too "l33t" for us.

Yours lovingly,

Someone, somewhere, but definately in the REAL scene.
