Thanks to our fellow scene-police who caught this bastard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today we're going to inform you of some of his friends.
They've been with each other quite some time now, and it just seems fair that now when everyone
knows samST, we'll introduce you to these mates!

Main User: pPer / g0rhee / NORDiVE /
Connected users: bro, hamster, Duskeren, Crille, shujinko, kont, Slinja, EvolutionX, optima, Xci
Connected groups: BiRDFLU

Friend,or at least known to these guys: amagerdude / GhostDK

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well here is our friend pPer, he likes to play CS, yeah he even has his own CS server on one of his
rented .DE's listed below. He also likes to leak scene-releases to the p2p public and is well known
at several major torrent communities.
I'm sure he likes to take long walks on the shore, breathe fresh air and throw big parties for his fellow torrenters.
But hold your horses all you CraZy women out there, he's already spoken for!
His girlfriend has actually been using his FTP accounts to leech various music, movies and such.


Full scenernick: pPerZ21
Nick used at irc: pPer / pPerz / pPerzZ
P2P-nicks: g0rhee , NORDiVE , sucker
Other nicks: bman ( http://bman.arto.dk ) < Isn't he cute?!
Realname: Well since we don't want him dead or anything, we wont expose that much...not yet at least.
We've got it, and if you keep doing this shit... well guess.


pPerz is ~pPerzz@LinkNet-c73d10f722.chickenkiller.com * pPerzz
pPerz on CENSORED, #birdflu is in the list
pPerz using link-net.org LinkNet IRC Network
pPerz is an SSL Encrypted Client
pPerz has been idle 2hrs 58secs, signed on Tue Nov 21 01:44:31
pPerz End of /WHOIS list.

pPer has a lot of rented boxes (primarily in .de) which he is using to seed at various trackers.
He uses the ip: 213.185.17.251 < At least for now, he'll soon move to another place with sweet oh sweet fiber
If you do a dns-lookup ( http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=213.185.17.251  ), you'll see that the ip
is a part of PERSPEKTIV-DK-NET, which is net host for the net used in primarily in Copenhagen (I'm sure your pregnant
girlfriend likes the big city! Oh and give her a hug from us will ya?! )

Well.. lets move on to the fun part:

First off, we've got some information about his CS server. Oh and yeah he's probably going to start seeding with this box aswell:

IP: 88.198.23.236 
Rented from: www.hetzner.de
Other ip-adress: 88.198.33.0/30
Financer:
Herr Flemmin *****
******* ** * *
***** PARIS E
FRANCE
(We've censored this since we don't want this guy dead either...maybe just bruised. 
Oh and yeah we've got his phone nr and email too. pPer want us to call him?)

Open ports:
22 SSH 
8000 sBNC 
8001 sBNC SSL 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The server below is used by pPer and his friends (listed below after this..)
Here he has got accounts for his p2p friends, and 
almost everything pPer leech is fxped to this server

"pPerZ21 attempting download to a foreign address 88.198.45.76".

Nice info about the ip:

IP: 88.198.45.76
Rented from: www.hetzner.de
Other ip: Unknown
Financer: Unknown - Viva La France maybe? ;)
Open Ports:

   * 42347 GlFTPD version 2.01 (username is g0rhee)
   * 3333 Eggdrop (g0r @ irc.p2p-irc.net, More info avaible)
   * 10300 VNC version 3.3
   * 80 Apache version 1.3 with PHP
   * 22 SSH
   * unknown sBNC


If you do a /whois on the bots nick at p2p-irc you'll see that it is in a chan called #sceneaccess
all alone. pPer must have forgot to remove this chan from the bots list when they renamed their
"leet" site-chan.

We tried to execute a few commands to see check if it was alive, and lookie!.. it announced some nice
info about their activities:

As you can see some of the users from the swedish group "BiRDFLU" is listed (check info further down)
The other users are primarily p2p-users from the torrentsite www.nordic-t.org like the ones below:

Well this fellah is on some of the sites that pPer is on. As you can see above he actually uploads once in a while,
so he must be at least somewhat active in the scene.

Info about p2p-group BiRDFLU

Well other than they're not really that big, not much is known.
We know that most of them, well all of them probably, have strong connections to p2p.
And all of their releases are listed on various large torrent trackers just seconds, or minutes after their scene-pre.

Some of the members:

Crille  zeus@LinkNet-dc6a420aa7.on.her-face.com 
shujinko  knekt@LinkNet-960ee0a28b.siw.siwnet.net < Remember this one?

Oh and of course pPer, hmm I wonder what his girlfriend thinks of Crille...

We doubt he has any connection to the group BiRDFLU or any of their members, but we've seen him on various sites,
and we don't like him or his pay-for-leech tracker.
He's a major uploader at swedvdr as you can see...and a major downloader aswell.
Don't worry we'll gather some more intel, so his fans can send him some Lööööve letters!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And last but not least, just some Lööve letters and information about g0rhee:

pPer had his own tracker but it got shutdown by the germans (he ran it on a rented .de)

Hello..

I downloaded: 
Like.Minds.2006.NORDIC.PAL.DVDR-RaDiuS that is sized 4.40GB. But my account only says that i downloaded 2.20GB?
Is that true? that some of it is free leech or something?
Im really new here, but not to tracker (got my own nordic tracker).
Looking forward to hear from you. 

Greetings
g0rhee
