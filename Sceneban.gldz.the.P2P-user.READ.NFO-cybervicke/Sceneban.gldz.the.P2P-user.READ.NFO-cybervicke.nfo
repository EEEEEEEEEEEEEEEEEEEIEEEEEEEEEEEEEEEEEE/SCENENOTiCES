We heard a suspicious rumor about a trader called gldz. 
We heard that he had been involved with p2p, but quit. Sadly enough, 
he was not "just" involved, he was, or still is very active 
leaking from the scene. 

So we contacted the guy, and asked him about this. And hey, this 
was really easy. 5 minutes chatting, and we got a confession. 



[11:42:58] <gldz> Jag satt på Swebits..
[11:43:04] <gldz> om du vet vad det är världens mest hatade tracker
[11:43:18] <gldz> Jag var uploader där.. 

In english this is: 
<gldz> I were active at Swebits..
<gldz> if you know what it is, it is the most hated tracker in the world
<gldz> I were an uploader there.. 


He also confessed the usage of direct connect.. wich didn't really improve
his situation. ^^

[11:43:30] <gldz> Han frågade efter nån bra dc rar hubb
[11:43:38] <gldz> jag gav han regg hubb till en hubb..

English: 
<gldz> He asked me for some good dc rar hub
<gldz> I gave him reg in one hub.. 


This confessions should be enough to purge him, but for you who 
still doesn't, more facts is coming. Continue reading. 



A whois shows us this... 
----------------
gldz is na@h35n2fls31o898.telia.com * na
gldz using link-net.org LinkNet IRC Network
gldz is an SSL Encrypted Client
gldz End of /WHOIS list.
----------------

This gives the ip 217.209.140.35. Nice and secure, huh? 


A little closer look shows us he has been active on EFNet, 
with the nick cybervick. 

cybervick is ~cybervick@h35n2fls31o898.telia.com * na
cybervick using irc.dataphone.se Stockholm, Sweden
cybervick End of /WHOIS list.

Bouncing it around to some sources, and we got a confirmation 
that the nick "cybervicke" was very active as an uploader for many 
months on Swebits. 



Siteops having this guy on site, read this and act to secure the scene. 

And you other security issues on the scene, beware. This guy was very 
easy to get information from. We recieved very interesting logs 
from him when he tried to proof his innocence, so we got a lot of things
to do. You are NOT safe. You can run, but you can't hide! 



Adding sfv to make it more noticable when racing. 


Peace out.
