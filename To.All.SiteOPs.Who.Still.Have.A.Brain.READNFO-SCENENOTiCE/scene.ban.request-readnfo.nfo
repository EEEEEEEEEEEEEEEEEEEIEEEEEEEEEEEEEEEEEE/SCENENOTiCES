Ok, this shit is getting ridiculous...

TRADINGSTANDARDS. It's really an insult to even call these guys a scene group.
I'm sure most of you know they really aren't, and I'm sure no decent site allows
their garbage releases to reach it.

This is a request to others, to act now, and stop spreading this shit and wasting
bandwith. This group has been in the scene for 4-5 months now, and no one has done
anything about it. Their nuke ratio is close to 95% (new record! lol), and most of
the nukes are because they use p2p sources (wich are watermarked) or even worse:
just repack a p2p release. And as real idiots, they ALWAYS get caught doing it.

Do we really need these pricks around? TRADINGSTANDARS, leave the scene now and
don't try to come back, because we will all know who you are, since your releases
are about as usefull as a used tampon. Peace out.
