       MXS Massive Insecurity:
 
         Some Users from those grp and ofc from some more got preAccess and are
         able to nuke and unnuke release.
         Example for MXS Unnuking own releases : [ NUKE ] [The_Soundalikes-Oldies_Rhythm

         Some of those grp are nuking other grps with no good reasons for preing
         rlses before them reasons like : bad rip etc.(there are proffs have a channel 
         with MXS owners there).
         
         MXS Owner is unsecure he doesnt use bnc and idle on some xdcc chans nick is 
         GANGST3R aka TRYER, he speaks alot in public chans about scene etc "u will see
         on scene info"

         MXS spam db with false Announces fake pre etc and use forums to recruit 
         Example:www.kriminalmusic.blogspot.com > kriminal is in MXS team member and share scene rlz 
         on the website.
 
         MXS idle on red latina server on irc xdcc channel (spanish chans) They re-encode mp3 
         but they change nick there (they are not completely stupid) and on AFter-All server 
         (famous for fxp board and hackers). 
         and about the members: if the Owner so unsecure what about the Members.
 
         WE DID SOME SEARCHING AND WE FOUND:
