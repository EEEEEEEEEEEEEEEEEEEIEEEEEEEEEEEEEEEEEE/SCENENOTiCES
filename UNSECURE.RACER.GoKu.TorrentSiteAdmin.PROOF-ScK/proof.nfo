Goku was a user on a site and purged for refusing to upload. 
He always begged for leech and or exempt from quota. When
we had enough of the begging and agreed to purge him he was
a bit pissed non the less and that is when the info started 
in about how he was a big player in the torrent world. I
had a friend of a friend who is on the staff for TorrentMatrix 
get me his account info and view the info needed for the proof.

Look at the image proof.gif for a screenshot sent to me.

Here is GoKu's info

I don't really now what else there is the say - if you keep this
user in your group then you support torrents and should be banned 
yourself.

As a fellow SOP I request this user (ftp user = goku) be purged to 
save yourself and your UDB / ADB.

Have a great day and keep racing in safety
