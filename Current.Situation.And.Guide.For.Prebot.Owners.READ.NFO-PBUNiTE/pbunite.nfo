   This is the first scene-notice from us, as we, prebot owners, have been
   watching too long for now how the things have gone.

   This nfo contains current things that NEED to be fixed. It also has
   some solutions for them. It is intended for prebot owners, if you dont
   own one you probably wont do anything with this notice.


   #1 Bots Echoing From Filtered Sitechans

     This is why we see those echos with underlines replaced with dots and
     so on. So now, _every_ prebot owner, stop echoing from preannounce
     channels. Why the hell even do that? If your bots echoes, echo from
     those channels designed for bots. DO NOT try to guess missing characters
     or try to fix the releasename IN ANY WAY! Just send it over in the
     same condition you got it.

   #2 PreHQ Security

     Recently, there has been some PreHQ's widely open. Most of them were on
     EFNet, and were open for everybody. Yea, even for NON-SCENERS if you
     just knew the channel or guessed it. This is one reason why prespam
     has been grown lately. Even most of the sceners shouldn't have access to
     these places if they dont run a prebot, so why the hell non-sceners have.
     So SECURE YOUR CHANNELS NOW!

   #3 Nuke/Unnuke Looping

     This is not really an issue for good bots who dont take the nukes
     again. Main issue with this is that it causes spam, and shows
     how many noob bots there are. Why even announce nukes like a 4
     hours after the real nuketime? Yea, they're looping and wont
     stop it. They also cause problems with other things issued in this nfo

   #4 Adding Old Releases

     This is caused by adding on new dirs. Bots should only add from
     REAL SITEPRES. Again it messes up db's and bots with small databases.
     (small db for whatever reason, it could be also speed issue on the adder)

   #5 Stolen Or Shitty Scripts

     Wow, there really are people who cant script their bots but still
     are running them. They have either received it or stolen it from
     some other prebot owner. IF YOU CANT HANDLE SOMETHING, DONT DO IT.
     If you cant handle your bot, DONT RUN IT! OR AT LEAST DONT ADD AND
     SCREW UP EVERYONES DB'S!

   #6 Prespam And Fakes

     This is the worst thing ever. There are way too many noobs around preadd
     scene today. Probably everyone noticed the Lost thing yesterday. First,
     someone added a fake 6 hours before the pre, guessing the dirname
     (and its usually the same). Now, all prebots saved the pretime of it.
     Some did delpre. Some racers actually raced the empty dir around.
     Now, right before the real pre came another addpre, and LOL released
     it five minutes later. Prebots got that old time, and we're autonuking
     on sites for backfill. The real release spread very hardly around, and
     very slow. Sites nuked the old as fake, and racers couldn't make
     dir for the real release. Then after the XOR proper came more and more
     prespam and racers raced empty dirs around. And again predb's are filled
     with fake pres and dirname of the next weeks Lost. Really mature guys.
     And because of delpre's, other db's have it and other dont. Then they're
     always adding old releases and messing it up, nukelooping and nuking
     the REAL RELEASE for fake because it was fake before the group really
     pred it. WTF GUYS!

   #7 FXP board, public and P2P prebots

     These aren't tolerated either. In addition to that they leak pre
     info, they allow to spam shit. And heres one of the P2P bots: _martin
     Its running on a large PreHQ at EFNet and has connections to torrent
     sites. This goes to all of you too, if you leak preinfo and spam shit,
     you will get banned.

   So stop this shit now. In your db start saving the botname who first
   added the release for you, same for nukes and unnukes. This information will
   come handy soon. If you have shitty scripts, please try to fix them. We will
   soon autonuke bad echos and if our bot sees your bot as the first adder,
   you bot's nick will show up on the nuke.
