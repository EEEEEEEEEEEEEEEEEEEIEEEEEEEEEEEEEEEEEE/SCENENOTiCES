Just a lil info on this gay ass ...

Desi AKA joaquin ( sologigabit )is the a big fraudster .. if u are looking to take a grafix box, I would suggest goin direct to grafix not through him .. 
He takes your money , then adds extra bw costs for his own ends .. he also make u pay for your own hdds then keeps em for new customers .

This guy is the reason that the grafix /truel.nl is now screwed 
The bw is oversold .. 8 plus servers on a switch what is upposed to be dedicated link (lol)

Due to a recent bust of 1 of his servers (ethz) his friend  a big seller he is tryin to scam existing customers .

he is giving random prices as he feels .. 

So all solo users grafix ppl beware :) 

Have a good night .. 
Much love 


A friendly scener ......
