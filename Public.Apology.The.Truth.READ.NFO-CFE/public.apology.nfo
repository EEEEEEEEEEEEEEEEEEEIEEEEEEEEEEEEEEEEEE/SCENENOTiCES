There once was a team, CFE. CFE was no ordinary team but instead was a team that was founded upon the ground of loyalty and trust. Unfortunately, that trust was broken. No sense beating around the bushes, because the bushes don't go away. It doesn't matter so much how it is worded, but instead, needs to be said. I fucked the founder of CFE. We made a vow when starting the team not to let the team get between us, but it has. The team would not have been what it is today without the continual efforts of ALL the team members involved. But, and yes there is a BIG but, it wouldn't have even had a chance to let the team members become involved if it wasn't for the two ORIGINAL founders of the team.

Unfortunately, the team has alienated the founders. So much so that the team is now dying because of it. If there was anything that could have been said or could have been done, it is now too late. There exists an uncertainty for both of the founders of the said team because they no longer have much to speak for. They both invested a ton of resources into the team and received nothing or very little to speak of, in return.

Yes, you heard it here, THEY were fucked. The worst part, however, is, that while one founder was left out, alienated from the team, the other sat by and took it. The time has come for this to end. No more!

Please accept my public apology to all involved in one way or another. I hope that the said team realizes that they are heading down a slippery slope and do something to correct their actions.
