   And again you see what happens when you dont keep your channels
   secure and lamers out. Idiots spamming tons of prespam, faking
   RELOADED and DEViANCE releases as propers and repacks.

   martin aka n0name was last time using PUBLIC(!) addprechannels to
   run his P2P bot. KEEP YOUR CHANNELS SECURE, DO NOT ALLOW LAMERS
   THERE! This spamming has gotten worse and worse every day!

   PREBOTS UNITE arranges channel and a meeting place for serious prebot
   owners soon, to discuss this thing and how to get the lamers out.
   We hope every PreHQ owner will take part of it. However we need to
   check people before we invite them to meeting, to take noobs and
   other lamers out. If you would like to take a part in the meeting,
   please mail us at pbunite@hush.com. 

   Save the scene before it gets just retarted. Its not far from there.
   
   
   
   If you have questions, would like to discuss this thing, or want
   to help out, you can contact us via pbunite@hush.com
