We have ourselves yet another P2P user whom was able to sneak his way into the prenet scene.
 
 sos is connecting from *@82.130.11.130 82.130.11.130
 
 His attempts to leak sitepre are evident in his botched code:
 
 <droneNET> .::[DEVOICE]::[ sos has been devoiced in #drone.sitepre for adding a release containing invalid characters [(.*))/Si:#Possie,#Possie-Spam:{ || (.*)]. Please implement the appropriate filters. ]::.
 
 Then we see this prespam coming from sos (See for yourself, most bots have this coming from sos on EliteNet)
 
 ADDPRE [Zabikt.Check.This.Out.Fag.S010E01.XviD-heHz] [EliteNet\#hq\sos]
 
 Is a little spam worth a scene ban? Maybe if it's a shout out to a P2P user...

 DAHMER has been holding onto this information for a while now. We
 believe sos is still involved in P2P so we are blowing the whistle.
 
 Notes: We wrote some scripts to farm iPhone EXIF data from
 MP3 proof images and couldn't believe what we found.
 
 Jesus fucking christ people! Run your photos through an app
 that clears EXIF data before packing it into a release. That
 shit can contain your GPS coordinates.
