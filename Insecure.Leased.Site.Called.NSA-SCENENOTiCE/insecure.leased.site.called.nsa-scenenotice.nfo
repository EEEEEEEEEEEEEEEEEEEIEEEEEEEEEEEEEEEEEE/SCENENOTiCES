Want to give people a heads up about this insecure site run by rekan, Pias, labyrinth, krille|
and PulsE.. 

they are running a drftpd site called NSA, with these current BNCs:
main: 076.0113.0366.0106
backup: nsa.selfip.biz

so i did a traceroute on the nsa.selfip.biz - this is what i got

TraceRoute to 62.75.246.70 [nsa.selfip.biz]

turns out intergenia.de is a german hostingcenter or something like that..
i dont wanna waste too much time, so i haven't got ips on the other boxes.. 
but if you care about security and dont wanna be seen in a future nfo with udb,
you better leave the site ASAP!
this is what we were able to get from one of the siteops:

<rekan> The servers are hosted within the renting companies yes. But I have quite some contacts in that business, and neither of these are really rented. They are hosted by service/tech admins within each company

so its not just ONE rented box.. they're all rented... 
the reason i got suspicious was another guy saying it was rented, and the fact
that they have 3x 100/100, with only 1.1tb diskspace.. what a coincidence.
