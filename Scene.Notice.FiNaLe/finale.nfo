Okay , after a breach in security at a site we investigated some things and found the GADMIN of FiNaLe was behind hacking
a siteop account (we still dont know exactly waht happened our best educated guess is a socks proxy form an addline)
this user is a massive security risk and if your site is affiliating FiNaLe i would reccommend highly that u drop them now.
when confronted about this he acted dumb lol.
i dont really want to go into Details so i have included a few logs from our encrypted archive for your viewing pleasure

A WHOIS OF DOODMAN (LINKNET)

[ /whois list for: [dooDman-0]

To summise , i know usually these scene notices are lame but 3 siteops aggreed this was the best course of action, especially in the hard tomes the scene is facing @ the moment due to security risks,
all i ask is you consider dropping FiNaLe form your affiliates list as anyone with no regard for the safety of fellow affils (by releasing site info he would jeaprodise everyone) this just simply cannot happen
...
as we trawl our logs more we might pre some more proof , but for now i think this is enough

Thanks for reading

GREETZ - ALL TRUE SCENERS AND GROUPS KEEPING THE SITES AND SCENE ALIVE DURING THESE TESTING TIMES


- A CONCERNED OP

The logs used in this notice we're forwarded to me they have nothing to do with the siteops of the 2 CENSORED SITES

LASTLY IF TRHIS IS ONE BIG MISTAKE (I DONT HTINK IT IS THOUGH) APPOLOGIES TO FiNaLe
PLZ RESPOND TO THIS SCENE NOTICE TO CLEAR YOUR NAME
