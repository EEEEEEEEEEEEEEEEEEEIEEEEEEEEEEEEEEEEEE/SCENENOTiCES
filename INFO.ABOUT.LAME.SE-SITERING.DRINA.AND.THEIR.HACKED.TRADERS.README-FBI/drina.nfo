1. some infos about drina
2. what happend?
3. nicknames: siteops + some other strange users/traders!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. drina is a small 10mbit .se sitering (linknet) #drina, #drina-mp3, #drina-0day, no affils, not rated

2. when i was searching the web for some infos about rootservers etc. i got to this german website/forum. it's a forum where peoples
   can talk about their rootservers and help each other bla bla ;)
   ok, so i read one thread from a person who's SERVER GOT HACKED. yes, his server was hacked by some scriptkiddies, who installed
   a ftpserver and some other fucking tools to have a fucking server to trade their fucking warez and so on.. you know the story :(
   in any case some of the users from rootforum.de tried to get some infos about the noob hackers and they joined their irc chan at efnet
   and posted the userlist of the channel. and guess what? yes i knew some of the nickes from #drina !!!
   btw. the person who's server got hacked said that HE WENT TO THE GERMAN POLICE in this thread! you can ask a german friend to translate
   if u dont believe this :\ .. he's a big SECURITY RISK FOR EVERY TRADER, who are in the same chan with this homo!

who? --- [IceT] (~IceT@oc43.dualgbit.de) : IceT

   i talked with the siteop to talk with him etc. he did it AND IceT even told him that it was HE who was in this hacked project! but 
   the siteop believed him that IceT doesnt trade on hacked servers anymore OMG STFU lol
   he is using the same nick which he used on hacked servers on legits omg lame
   i think the only reason is, why IceT was delusered is, that he is the "top mp3 trader" of drina lol
   drina is bad mp3 supported and IceT is trading 30mins+ pre their all the day, so he's always in the daysstats
   the pretime of the mp3rlses IceT is trading on drina would be backfill on any EcL rated mp3site...

Nov 14 18:21:37 <jc100>	he promised me
Nov 14 18:21:42 <jc100>	none of the sites he uses here are hacked
Nov 14 18:21:57 <jc100>	i told him that he better not dare risk our sites with hacked sites
Nov 14 18:21:59 <xx>	but did he agreed that it was HE in the list of the website?
Nov 14 18:22:11 <jc100>	yes
Nov 14 18:22:17 <jc100>	but he told me that he doesnt used hacked to non hacked
Nov 14 18:22:43 <jc100>	good enough i guess
Nov 14 18:22:49 <jc100>	as its really hard to say that no one else does it
Nov 14 18:22:57 <jc100>	but i made it clear he is not to use hacked sites on drina
Nov 14 18:23:15 <xx>	just for the case he used hacked sites in the past i would purge him :\
Nov 14 18:23:51 <jc100>	if it was anyone else i would      <------ no comment
Nov 14 18:23:55 <jc100>	but he ups liek 50 GB / month =X  
Nov 14 18:23:58 <xx>	so?
Nov 14 18:24:18 <xx>	he aint a good trader, he just traded much :x <---- yes much old crap
Nov 14 18:25:04 <jc100>	what do u mean
Nov 14 18:25:20 <jc100>	as long as he ISNT hacking the sites, and using to drina, shouldnt be a big problem
Nov 14 18:25:24 <jc100>	if he was the one hacking them id be a bit more pissed
Nov 14 18:25:46 <jc100>	from what i gather he just trades on them, stupid yes, but they will go after the person that hacked it
Nov 14 18:25:48 <jc100>	not the traders
Nov 14 18:26:16 <xx>	site deluser xx me then
Nov 14 18:27:26 <jc100>	is it cause of iceT?
