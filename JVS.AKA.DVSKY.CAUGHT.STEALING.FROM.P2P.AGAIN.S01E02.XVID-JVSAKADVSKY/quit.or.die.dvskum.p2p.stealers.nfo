This is getting old and very annoying....

DVSKY are we going to have to give out your ips and names??? seriously, we dont want to put your affil sites in risk but 
if you continue to steal pres we will have no other choice other then to pre all your ips and information! 
quit this bullshit now! this is your last warning..,

if you steal one more pre, we will make you regret it!! This is not a bluff! or maybe it is... call it and find out! 

pho3nix you piece of shit stop denying dvsky steals from p2p, what do you think you're smarter then the entire scene?!? yeah right..

its so fucking obvious, IT IS A FACT YOU STEAL FROM P2P, YES IT IS CUMSUCKER! 
IF YOU REALLY BELEIVE ITS NOT STOLEN YOU ARE ONE STUPID GULLABLE MOTHERFUCKER!!!

so..... DVSKY pre's a goodbye notice (THANK GOD), only to come back as -JVS and continue to encode p2p sources....

guess what dvsky... you admitted to steal from p2p when you renamed the group do JVS. so stop denying it.

here's some more obvious proof you STILL steal from p2p

all of JVS' 3 pres are stolen...
