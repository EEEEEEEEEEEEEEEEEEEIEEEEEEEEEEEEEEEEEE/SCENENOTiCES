Here we go again... This time, it's serious since it's about a pretty active group that
everyone knows -> aWake

As the MDVDR of the popular dance event Qlimax reached p2p first, I knew some group would
steal it, so I kept my eyes open.

After aWake released "their" shit:

scene: Qlimax.2007.PAL.MDVDR-aWake (pred: 29/01/2008 13:11:38)


I downloaded both and compared. The image says it all. Who knows, they've probably done
this many times, but this time, they've been caught with their pants down. Please ban &
purge this group at once. This is more proof than you can ever ask for.
