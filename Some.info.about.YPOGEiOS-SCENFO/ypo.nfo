well, it came to this that 0day groups and site actually banned us.
i would like to explain this to all 0day top groups that had issues with us.

we *know* converters are extremely easy to do mov eax 1 retn
we know that

but we also know you guys liked our trainers

now here is the deal, we agreed to stop preing this "0day crap" as respect for top groups. but come on guys, changing our grp name? no way.

and about this nfo`s running around recently about OUTLAWS and YPOGEiOS we would trace where it came from in the end

so..
we do stop this crap
and we dont care much for sites who banned us

and we also respect all top ranked such as CORE that allow me to listen to songs with winamp :)
as well as AMAZING!!! PARADOX that came out with there Preee
and thats all i had in mind sorry all the others :)

Greets :D

p.s
FUCK ALL P2P!
